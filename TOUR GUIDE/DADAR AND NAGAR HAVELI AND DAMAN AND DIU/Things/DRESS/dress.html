    <h1>DRESS</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <p>The traditional attire of the people of Dadra and Nagar Haveli reflects the simplicity and connection to nature of the tribal communities, especially among the Warlis, Dublas, Koknas, and Dhodiyas. These communities’ dress styles are practical, using natural materials suited to the climate and lifestyle while also showcasing their unique cultural identity.</p>
        
        <b class="heading">1. Traditional Dress for Men</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dhotis and Waistcloths</strong>: The traditional attire for men consists mainly of dhotis, a piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and extending to the knees. In many tribal communities, men prefer to wear these waistcloths, especially during ceremonies and festivals.</li>
            <li><strong>Turbans</strong>: Men often wear turbans, which vary in color and style depending on the tribe and occasion. Turbans are not only a cultural marker but also practical, protecting from the sun during outdoor activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Upper Garments</strong>: In some tribes, men wear simple shirts or angarkhas (a type of tunic) as upper garments. However, during hot weather, they often remain bare-chested, given the warm climate of the region.</li>
        </ul>

        <b class="heading">2. Traditional Dress for Women</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lugda or Sari</strong>: Women typically wear a *lugda* (a type of sari) draped in a style unique to the tribal communities. The lugda is often shorter than a conventional sari and tied above the knees, allowing ease of movement, especially in rural and forested areas.</li>
            <li><strong>Blouses and Bodices</strong>: To complement the lugda, women wear simple blouses or bodices, generally in earthy tones and natural fabrics, reflecting the region’s rustic charm.</li>
            <li><strong>Ornamental Borders and Bright Colors</strong>: Traditional saris and lugdas often have bright colors with simple ornamental borders, such as red, orange, or green, adding a festive touch.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><strong>Nose Rings and Earrings</strong>: Women also wear nose rings, earrings, and sometimes even silver armlets, highlighting the tribal aesthetic and their connection to heritage. These pieces are usually handcrafted and passed down through generations.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple Ornaments for Men</strong>: Men may wear simpler ornaments, such as necklaces made from beads or metal pendants, particularly during festivals or dance performances.</li>

            <li><strong>Warli and Tribal Influence</strong>: Attire for special occasions often features traditional Warli motifs or designs inspired by nature, like leaves, animals, and geometric shapes.</li>
        </ul>

        <b class="heading">5. Contemporary Influence</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blending of Modern and Traditional</strong>: With modernization, some younger generations have adopted a blend of traditional and contemporary clothing, such as pairing the traditional lugda with modern blouses or incorporating more comfortable fabrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Festival and Event Dressing</strong>: While modern clothing has become popular in day-to-day wear, the traditional dress still holds significant value during festivals, ceremonies, and other cultural events.</li>
        </ul>
