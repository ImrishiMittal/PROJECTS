            <h1>TRIPURA</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div class="size">Tripura, one of the northeastern states of India, is a region rich in cultural heritage, natural beauty, and historical significance. Nestled in the northeastern part of the country, it is bordered by Bangladesh on three sides, and the Indian states of Assam and Mizoram to the east. With Agartala as its capital, Tripura is the third smallest state in India but holds immense cultural and ecological diversity.

        <div class="size">
            The history of Tripura is deeply intertwined with the legacy of the Manikya dynasty, which ruled the region for several centuries. The Ujjayanta Palace in Agartala, built by Maharaja Radha Kishore Manikya in the early 20th century, is a stunning representation of Tripura's royal past. This architectural marvel, set amidst lush Mughal-style gardens, now serves as a state museum, offering insights into the rich history and cultural heritage of the state.

            Tripura is also known for its ancient temples and religious sites. The Tripura Sundari Temple, located in Udaipur, is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas and is a major pilgrimage site. The temple, dedicated to Goddess Kali, attracts devotees from all over the region. Similarly, the Unakoti hills are famous for their rock-cut sculptures dating back to the 7th-9th centuries. These magnificent carvings depict Hindu deities and are a testament to the state's rich spiritual history.

            The state's cultural tapestry is woven with the traditions of its diverse tribal communities. The indigenous tribes of Tripura, such as the Tripuris, Reangs, Jamatias, and Chakmas, contribute to the state's vibrant cultural milieu. Traditional festivals like Kharchi Puja, Garia Puja, and Ker Puja are celebrated with much fervor, showcasing the unique customs, music, and dance forms of these communities. The folk music and dances, including Hojagiri and Lebang Boomani, reflect the cultural richness and traditions passed down through generations.
