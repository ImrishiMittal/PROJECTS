        <ul>
            <li><strong>Early Settlements</strong>: Tripura’s history can be traced back to ancient times.

It is believed to have been ruled by the <i>Tripuri</i> dynasty. The kingdom's early history is mostly mythical, with the <i>Tripuri kings</i> mentioned in the <i>Vedic</i> and <i>Puranic texts</i>, including the <i>Mahabharata</i>.</li>
            <li><strong>Mahabharata Connection</strong>: The earliest references to Tripura appear in the <i>Mahabharata</i>, where the kingdom is said to have been ruled by <i>King Tripur</i>, an important figure in the epic.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynastic History</strong>: Tripura's earliest kings, particularly during the <i>Mongal dynasty</i>, are said to have ruled the region from around the 10th century CE, though there is no definitive written evidence from this period.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">2. Medieval Period (12th–18th Century)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Kingdom of Tripura</strong>: By the 12th century, the region became a well-established kingdom under the <i>Mongol dynasty</i>, which was founded by <i>Raghunath Manikya</i> in the 15th century. The <i>Manikya dynasty</i> ruled Tripura for almost 500 years, with the capital initially being at <i>Udaipur</i> and later at <i>Agartala</i>.</li>
            <li><strong>Influences of Hinduism and Buddhism</strong>: Tripura, like many parts of the northeastern region, saw a strong influence of both <i>Hinduism</i> and <i>Buddhism</i> over the centuries. The <i>Tripura Sundari Temple</i>, dedicated to the Hindu goddess <i>Durga</i>, is one of the most important religious sites in the region.</li>
            <li><strong>Mughal Influence</strong>: In the 16th and 17th centuries, Tripura came under the influence of the Mughal Empire, although it was never fully integrated into the empire. The kingdom maintained a degree of independence while still interacting with the Mughal rulers in terms of trade and political alliances.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">3. Colonial Era (18th Century–1947)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>British Rule</strong>: During the British colonial period, Tripura was ruled by the <i>Manikya Dynasty</i> under the British Raj. The British recognized the <i>Tripura Kingdom</i> as a princely state, and it enjoyed autonomy while being under British suzerainty.</li>
            <li><strong>Rulers of the Manikya Dynasty</strong>: <i>Bir Chandra Manikya</i> (1862–1896) was one of the most notable rulers of Tripura during the British period. He implemented reforms, including infrastructure development, education, and modernization.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration into India</strong>: After India’s independence in 1947, the princely state of Tripura acceded to the newly formed Indian Union in 1949, following the <i>Manikya dynasty’s agreement</i> with the Indian government. Tripura officially became a Union Territory in 1956.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">4. Post-Independence Era</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Union Territory Status (1956–1963)</strong>: After its integration into India, Tripura was initially designated as a Union Territory. During this period, the state underwent significant changes in terms of administration, infrastructure, and economic development.</li>
            <li><strong>Statehood (1963)</strong>: Tripura became a full-fledged state in <i>1963</i>, with <i>Agartala</i> as its capital. The state continued to see rapid changes and modernizations, but it also faced challenges such as ethnic conflicts, migration issues, and political instability.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">5. Modern History and Politics</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ethnic Conflicts and Migrants</strong>: One of the major challenges Tripura faced post-independence was ethnic tensions between the indigenous communities and the influx of Bengali migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). These tensions led to communal strife and insurgency movements, particularly during the 1980s and 1990s. The insurgent group <i>Tripura Tribal Areas Tribal Force (TTAF)</i> sought greater autonomy for indigenous people.</li>
            <li><strong>Peace Accord and Development</strong>: In 1988, a peace accord was signed between the Indian government and the <i>Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT)</i>, bringing some level of resolution to the conflicts. Since then, Tripura has focused on economic growth, infrastructure development, and better governance.</li>
            <li><strong>Political Landscape</strong>: Over the years, Tripura has seen a number of changes in its political landscape, with the <i>Left Front</i> (mainly the Communist Party of India – Marxist) dominating the state’s politics for several decades. However, in the 2018 state elections, the <i>BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party)</i> emerged as the ruling party, marking a significant shift in Tripura’s political narrative.</li>
        </ul>
