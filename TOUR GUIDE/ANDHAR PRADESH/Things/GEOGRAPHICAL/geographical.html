    <h1>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <div>
            Andhra Pradesh, situated on the southeastern coast of India, is the seventh-largest state in the country by area and the tenth-largest by population. The state is bordered by Telangana to the northwest, Chhattisgarh to the north, Odisha to the northeast, Tamil Nadu to the south, Karnataka to the west, and the Bay of Bengal to the east. This strategic location contributes significantly to its diverse geography, climate, and economic activities.

            <b>Coastal Plains and River Systems</b>
            <br>
            The eastern boundary of Andhra Pradesh is flanked by the Bay of Bengal, giving it a coastline of approximately 972 kilometers, the second-longest in India. This coastal region is characterized by fertile plains and river deltas, primarily formed by the Godavari and Krishna rivers. These rivers, along with several smaller ones like the Penna and the Vamsadhara, play a crucial role in the state’s agriculture, making it one of the richest rice-producing regions in the country. The deltas are known for their lush green fields, abundant water resources, and dense population centers.

        <div>
            <b>Eastern Ghats</b>
            <br>
            The Eastern Ghats, a discontinuous range of mountains, run parallel to the coast and extend into Andhra Pradesh. These hills are prominent in the eastern part of the state, contributing to the varied topography. The Ghats are home to dense forests, diverse flora and fauna, and several tribal communities. Notable peaks include the Araku Valley and the Horsley Hills, which are popular tourist destinations due to their scenic beauty and pleasant climate.

        <div>
            <b>Central Plateau and Inland Regions</b>
            <br>
            Inland from the coastal plains, the geography transitions into the Deccan Plateau, a large plateau that covers most of central and southern India. This region of Andhra Pradesh is characterized by undulating terrain, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid conditions. The Rayalaseema region in the southwest of the state falls within this plateau and is known for its unique landscape, which includes the rugged terrain of the Nallamala Hills and the Seshachalam Hills. These hills are also home to the famous Tirumala Venkateswara Temple in Tirupati.
