     <b>Telugu: The Official Language</b><br>
    Telugu is the official language of Andhra Pradesh and is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Often referred to as the "Italian of the East" due to its melodious and rhythmic quality, Telugu is part of the Dravidian language family. It has a rich literary tradition that dates back over a thousand years, with classical poets like Nannaya, Tikkana, and Yerrapragada, who translated the Mahabharata into Telugu, significantly contributing to its literature. <br>
    
    The Telugu script is syllabic and consists of a complex system of characters, making it unique and distinct. The language is known for its extensive use of compound words and agglutinative grammar. Modern Telugu literature continues to thrive, with notable contributions in poetry, novels, and cinema.
