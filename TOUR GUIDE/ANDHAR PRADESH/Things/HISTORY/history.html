                Andhra Pradesh, located in the southeastern part of India, has a rich and diverse history that spans thousands of years. This region has seen the rise and fall of various dynasties, the influence of different cultures, and significant contributions to Indian art, architecture, and politics.

                <b>Ancient and Classical Period</b><br>
                The earliest records of Andhra Pradesh date back to the Vedic period, where it was known as the home of the Andhras, an ancient Dravidian tribe. The region is mentioned in the Aitareya Brahmana of the Rigveda, indicating its significance even in ancient times. 
                <br>  
                The Maurya Empire, under Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE, incorporated Andhra Pradesh into its vast territory. After the fall of the Mauryas, the Satavahanas emerged as a dominant power around 230 BCE. They ruled the Deccan region, including Andhra Pradesh, for nearly four centuries. The Satavahanas are known for their contributions to art, culture, and architecture, including the construction of stupas and viharas. The Amaravati Stupa, an important Buddhist site, is a testament to their architectural prowess.

                <b> Medieval Period</b><br>
                The decline of the Satavahanas led to the rise of several smaller kingdoms, including the Ikshvakus, Pallavas, and the Vishnukundinas. The Eastern Chalukyas, who ruled from the 7th to the 12th centuries, played a crucial role in the history of Andhra Pradesh. Their reign marked a period of prosperity and cultural development. They established the city of Vengi as their capital, which became a significant center of learning and culture.
                <br>
                In the 11th century, the region came under the control of the Chola dynasty. The Cholas were known for their administrative efficiency and contributions to temple architecture. The influence of the Cholas waned by the late 12th century, giving rise to the Kakatiya dynasty.

                <b>The Kakatiya Dynasty</b><br>
                The Kakatiyas, with their capital at Warangal, were prominent rulers from the 12th to the 14th centuries. They are remembered for their administrative reforms, including the establishment of a centralized feudal system. The Kakatiyas also contributed significantly to temple architecture, as seen in the Thousand Pillar Temple and the Ramappa Temple. Their reign ended with the invasion of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century.

            <div>
                <b>Vijayanagara Empire and Muslim Rule</b><br>
                The fall of the Kakatiyas was followed by a brief period of Muslim rule under the Bahmani Sultanate. In the mid-14th century, the Vijayanagara Empire rose to prominence and ruled much of southern India, including Andhra Pradesh. The empire is known for its patronage of arts and literature and the construction of the grand city of Hampi. <br>
                After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire in the late 16th century, Andhra Pradesh witnessed the rise of several smaller kingdoms and the establishment of European trading posts by the Dutch, French, and British.

                <b>British Rule and Independence</b>
                <br>
                By the early 19th century, the British East India Company had established control over Andhra Pradesh. The region played a significant role in the Indian independence movement, with leaders like Alluri Sitarama Raju and Tanguturi Prakasam leading the fight against British rule.

                <b>Post-Independence Era</b>
                <br>
                After India gained independence in 1947, Andhra Pradesh was formed by merging the Telugu-speaking regions of the Madras Presidency with the princely state of Hyderabad. The state was officially formed on October 1, 1953, with Kurnool as its capital. In 1956, the Telugu-speaking areas of Hyderabad State were merged with Andhra State to form the present-day Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as its capital.
                <br>
                In 2014, Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated to create the new state of Telangana. As a result, Andhra Pradesh lost Hyderabad as its capital. The state government later decided to develop Amaravati as the new capital city.
