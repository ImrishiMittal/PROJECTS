            <h1>TELANGANA</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div class="size">Telangana, the youngest state in India, was formed on June 2, 2014, after a long and persistent movement for separate statehood from Andhra Pradesh. Situated in the south-central region of the country, Telangana shares its borders with Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The state’s capital, Hyderabad, is a major center of technology and culture, often referred to as "Cyberabad" due to its thriving IT industry.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Telangana's history is deeply rooted in ancient civilizations and empires, including the Satavahanas, Kakatiyas, and the Golconda Sultanate. The region's historical and cultural legacy is reflected in its numerous forts, palaces, and temples. Notable historical sites include the Charminar, Golconda Fort, and the historic city of Warangal with its iconic Warangal Fort and the Thousand Pillar Temple. These landmarks highlight the architectural prowess and cultural richness of Telangana’s past.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Culturally, Telangana is known for its vibrant traditions, folk arts, and festivals. Bathukamma, the floral festival, is one of the most significant and widely celebrated festivals in the state, where women create flower arrangements and immerse them in water bodies. Bonalu is another major festival dedicated to the Goddess Mahakali, characterized by lively processions, music, and dance. The region’s folk arts, including Perini Shiva Thandavam, a traditional dance form, and Oggu Katha, a storytelling tradition, are integral to Telangana's cultural identity.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Telugu and Urdu are the primary languages spoken in Telangana, with Telugu being the official language. The state also has a rich literary tradition, with poets and writers contributing significantly to Telugu literature. The works of Kaloji Narayana Rao and Dasarathi Krishnamacharyulu are highly revered.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Telangana’s economy is diverse, with key sectors including agriculture, industry, and services. The state is one of India's major producers of rice, cotton, and maize. The industrial sector is robust, particularly in pharmaceuticals, textiles, and information technology. Hyderabad, known as the "Pharma City," houses numerous pharmaceutical companies and research institutions. Additionally, the city’s HITEC City (Hyderabad Information Technology and Engineering Consultancy City) is a major IT hub, attracting global tech giants and startups alike.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Tourism in Telangana is flourishing, thanks to its historical sites, natural beauty, and modern attractions. The state is home to scenic spots like the Ramappa Temple (a UNESCO World Heritage site), Kuntala Waterfalls, and the serene Hussain Sagar Lake in Hyderabad. The Ramoji Film City, one of the largest film studio complexes in the world, is a popular destination for tourists and film enthusiasts.

        <div class="size">
            Telangana's cuisine is a delightful blend of flavors, with spicy and tangy dishes that are distinct from the culinary traditions of its neighboring regions. Popular dishes include Hyderabadi biryani, Pesarattu (a type of dosa made with green gram), and various meat-based curries.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In terms of social development, Telangana has made significant strides in education and healthcare. The state government has implemented various schemes to improve literacy rates and provide accessible healthcare services to its residents.
        </div>

            Overall, Telangana is a state of dynamic contrasts, where ancient traditions coexist with modern advancements. Its cultural heritage, economic growth, and commitment to development make it a unique and vibrant part of India.
