                <li><strong>Mauryan and Post-Mauryan Periods:</strong> The region was part of the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century BCE. Following the decline of the Mauryas, the area came under the rule of several dynasties, including the <i>Satavahanas</i>, who established one of the earliest known kingdoms in South India.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Medieval Period</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kakatiya Dynasty (12th to 14th Century):</strong> The Kakatiyas were significant rulers who contributed to the region's architecture, culture, and irrigation. The famous <i>Warangal Fort</i> and the <i>Thousand Pillar Temple</i> were built during this period. They were known for their advances in art and literature.</li>
                <li><strong>Bahmani Sultanate and Deccan Sultanates:</strong> Following the Kakatiyas, the region became part of the Bahmani Sultanate in the 14th century, which later fragmented into smaller sultanates, including <i>Golconda</i> and <i>Bijapur</i>. This period saw the flourishing of Persian and Indo-Islamic culture.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Struggles for Identity:</strong> Following the merger, there were longstanding demands for recognition of Telangana’s unique cultural and linguistic identity, which led to feelings of neglect and discrimination in terms of development and resource allocation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">7. Statehood Movement</b>

                <li><strong>Telangana Movement:</strong> In the early 2000s, a renewed movement for a separate Telangana state gained momentum, driven by demands for local governance, employment opportunities, and equitable resource distribution.
