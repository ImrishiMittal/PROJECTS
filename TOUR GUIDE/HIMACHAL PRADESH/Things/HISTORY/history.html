                <li><strong>Kangra Fort and the Katoch Dynasty</strong>: The Kangra Fort is one of the oldest forts in India, and the Katoch dynasty is among the world's oldest surviving royal families. The fort and surrounding regions have a rich history of battles and strategic significance.</li>
                <li><strong>Influence of the Mughals</strong>: In the medieval era, Himachal Pradesh experienced incursions from the Mughal Empire, especially during Akbar's reign. However, the hill states maintained a degree of autonomy, paying occasional tribute but largely retaining their independence.</li>
                <li><strong>Sikh Period</strong>: In the early 19th century, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's empire extended into parts of Himachal Pradesh, including Kangra. The region saw conflicts but maintained relative peace in the hill states.</li>
