    <h1>DRESS</h1>
    <div class="big">
        The traditional dress of Himachal Pradesh reflects its mountainous terrain, cold climate, and vibrant culture. It is characterized by woolen garments, bright colors, intricate embroidery, and practical designs to withstand the cold weather. The attire varies slightly across regions, reflecting the distinct tribal and non-tribal influences within the state.

### **1. Men's Traditional Attire**
- **Kurta and Churidar/Pyjamas**: The typical attire for men consists of a long kurta paired with churidar or pyjamas. During the colder months, men often wear woolen coats or **cholas** (a long coat).
- **Bushehri Cap**: One of the most iconic elements of men's traditional attire is the Himachali cap (topi). The cap, which is made of wool, comes in various designs and colors, often denoting the region to which the wearer belongs. For instance, the Kinnauri cap features a green band, while other regions have their distinct patterns.
- **Woolen Shawls and Cloaks**: Men often drape a woolen shawl or pattu over their shoulders, especially during winter months. In some regions, such as Kinnaur and Spiti, heavy cloaks with intricate designs are worn for additional warmth.

### **2. Women's Traditional Attire**
- **Ghagra-Choli and Pattu**: Women in Himachal Pradesh often wear a **ghagra** (a long, flowing skirt) paired with a **choli** or blouse. Over their attire, women drape a **pattu**, a woolen shawl or wrap that is intricately woven and adorned with embroidery or traditional patterns. The pattu is worn over the head and shoulders, providing warmth and elegance.
- **Salwar-Kameez**: In some regions, women wear the **salwar-kameez** (a tunic paired with loose pants) along with a dupatta, often adorned with embroidery and vibrant patterns.
- **Jewelry**: Women in Himachal Pradesh traditionally adorn themselves with heavy silver jewelry, including **necklaces (hansli)**, **bangles**, **earrings**, **nose rings (nath)**, and **anklets**. The jewelry often reflects tribal influences and intricate craftsmanship, adding charm and beauty to their appearance.
- **Chamba Rumal**: This embroidered handkerchief or shawl, originally from the Chamba district, is known for its fine needlework and is often used during special occasions.

### **3. Regional Variations**
- **Kinnaur**: In the Kinnaur region, traditional attire includes woolen garments with elaborate designs, often accompanied by a distinctive green Kinnauri cap and silver jewelry. Women's dresses here are often colorful and heavily embroidered.
- **Lahaul and Spiti**: The attire in these regions is influenced by Tibetan culture due to geographical proximity. People often wear thick woolen coats called **Chhuba** and wrap themselves in yak wool shawls or cloaks to stay warm.
- **Kullu**: In Kullu, women traditionally wear a **ghagra** paired with a loose blouse and a pattu draped elegantly over the head and shoulders. The **Kullu shawls** are particularly famous for their colorful geometric patterns.

### **4. Accessories and Footwear**
- **Footwear**: In rural areas, people often wear **grass slippers** (known as **Pula**), especially in colder regions. These slippers are handmade and provide warmth and comfort.
- **Belts and Sashes**: Both men and women sometimes wear decorative belts and sashes around their waist, often as part of ceremonial attire.

### **Modern Influences**
While traditional attire remains a significant part of special occasions, festivals, and rural life, modern clothing is widely worn in urban areas of Himachal Pradesh. However, during cultural events, celebrations, and weddings, people proudly don their traditional dress, showcasing the rich heritage and beauty of their culture.
