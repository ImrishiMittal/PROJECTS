        <div>
            The traditional dress of Assam is deeply rooted in the state’s rich cultural heritage and reflects the
            simplicity and elegance of Assamese life. The clothing style varies based on ethnicity, occasion, and region
            but is largely characterized by the use of handwoven textiles, especially the famous <u>Muga silk</u>,
            <u>Pat silk</u>, and <u>Eri silk</u>, all of which are indigenous to Assam.

                <b class="head"> 1. Traditional Dress for Women:</b><br>
                The traditional attire for Assamese women is known as the <u>Mekhela Chador (or Mekhela Sador)</u>,
                which is an elegant two-piece garment.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        - Mekhela: The lower part of the dress, the <u>mekhela</u>, is a cylindrical piece of cloth worn
                        around the waist and tucked into place, resembling a sarong or long skirt. It is draped in
                        pleats, giving it a graceful appearance. The fabric can be made from Muga silk, cotton, or Pat
                        silk, depending on the occasion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Chador (Sador): The upper part, the <u>chador</u>, is a long, flowing cloth wrapped around the
                        upper body and tucked at the waist. It is often beautifully embroidered with traditional
                        Assamese motifs and designs. The chador is draped across the shoulder and worn in various styles
                        depending on the region or preference.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Blouse: Women wear a fitted blouse underneath the chador, often in contrasting or matching
                        colors. The blouse complements the Mekhela Chador, adding to its elegance.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For festive occasions like <u>Bihu </u> or weddings, the Mekhela Chador is often made from <u>Muga
                    silk</u> or <u>Pat silk</u> and is adorned with intricate golden or silver embroidery. The motifs
                used in the designs are inspired by nature, such as flowers, birds, and traditional Assamese patterns
                like the <u>Jaapi (traditional Assamese hat)</u> or <u>Xorai (a ceremonial offering tray).</u>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b class="head"> 2. Traditional Dress for Men:</b><br>
                The traditional attire for Assamese men is simpler but equally elegant, often characterized by the
                <u>dhoti</u>, <u>kurta</u>, and the <u>gamosa</u>.
                <ul>

                    <li>Dhoti: The <u>dhoti</u> is a long piece of cloth, usually white or cream, wrapped around the
                        waist and tied in place. It is paired with a <u>kurta</u>, a long, loose-fitting shirt. For
                        special occasions, men may wear silk dhotis with borders embroidered with traditional motifs.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        - Kurta: The <u>kurta</u> is worn over the dhoti and can be made of cotton, silk, or other fine
                        fabrics. It is typically plain, but for festive or religious ceremonies, it may have intricate
                        designs or embroidery.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Gamosa: The <u>gamosa</u> is a distinctive piece of cloth with a deep cultural significance in
                        Assam. It is a white handwoven towel with red borders and motifs and is often draped around the
                        neck or used ceremonially. The gamosa is a symbol of Assamese identity and pride and is commonly
                        gifted as a mark of respect or honor. It is also an important part of the Bihu dance costume for
                        men.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                For festivals and ceremonies, men may also wear a silk shawl known as <u>Seleng Chador</u> or <u>Eri
                    Chador</u> over their kurta.

                <b class="head"> 3. Festival and Wedding Attire:</b><br>
                - During festivals like <u>Bihu</u>, women often wear a special Mekhela Chador made from <u>Muga</u> or
                <u>Pat silk</u> with elaborate designs, while men may wear a traditional dhoti-kurta along with a
                colorful gamosa tied around the waist or head. Bihu dancers wear bright, vibrant Mekhela Chadors, often
                in red and gold, reflecting the energy and joy of the festival.

                - For weddings, Assamese brides wear a <u>red or cream Mekhela Chador</u> made of Muga silk, often
                intricately embroidered with golden thread. The bridal attire is traditionally elegant and rich in
                cultural significance. Grooms wear a <u>dhoti-kurta</u> paired with a <u>chador</u> draped over the
                shoulder, usually made from silk or a finely woven cotton fabric.
