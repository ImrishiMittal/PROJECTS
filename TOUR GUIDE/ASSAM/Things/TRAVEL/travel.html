        <div>
            The mode of transport in Assam is diverse and caters to both urban and rural populations.
            Given its unique geography, which includes the mighty Brahmaputra River, hilly terrains, and vast plains,
            Assam has developed various transportation modes to facilitate movement within the state and to neighboring
            regions.

            <b class="heading">1. Road Transport:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Buses</b>: Assam has an extensive road network connecting major cities and towns. <u>State
                        Transport
                        buses</u> operated by the Assam State Transport Corporation (ASTC) are a popular and affordable
                    mode
                    of transport for inter-city and intra-city travel. Private bus services also operate across the
                    state,
                    offering a range of options from luxury coaches to local minibuses.</li>
                <li><b>Taxis and Auto-Rickshaws</b>: Taxis and auto-rickshaws are commonly used in urban areas for
                    short-distance travel. <u>App-based taxi services</u> like Ola and Uber are available in cities like
                    Guwahati. In smaller towns, shared auto-rickshaws and cycle rickshaws are also a common mode of
                    transport.</li>
                <li><b>Private Vehicles</b>: Many residents own personal vehicles like motorcycles and cars, which are
                    convenient for commuting in both rural and urban areas.</li>
                <li><b>National Highways</b>: Assam is well-connected by major <u>National Highways</u> such as NH-27
                    and
                    NH-17, which link the state to other parts of India. Road infrastructure in Assam has been
                    improving,
                    although certain areas, especially during the monsoon season, can experience challenges due to
                    flooding
                    or poor road conditions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Rail Transport:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Indian Railways</b>: Assam is well-served by the Indian Railways network, which connects it to
                    other
                    parts of Northeast India and the rest of the country. Major railway stations like <u>Guwahati</u>,
                    <u>Dibrugarh</u>, <u>Tinsukia</u>, and <u>Jorhat</u> serve as important junctions for long-distance
                    trains.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <u>Rajdhani Express</u> and <u>Shatabdi Express</u> connect Assam to the national
                            capital,
                            Delhi, while trains like the <u>Brahmaputra Mail</u> and <u>Kamrup Express</u> provide
                            connectivity to Kolkata and other cities.</li>
                        <li><u>Local Trains</u>: There are also local and inter-state train services that connect
                            smaller
                            towns and villages within Assam and neighboring states, making rail transport one of the
                            most
                            accessible and economical modes of transport for long distances.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="heading">3. Air Transport:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport (Guwahati Airport)</b>: Located in Guwahati,
                    this is
                    the primary airport in Assam and the largest in the Northeast region. It serves both domestic and
                    international flights. Domestic flights connect Guwahati to major Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai,
                    Kolkata, and Bengaluru, while international flights connect to destinations like Bangkok and Dhaka.
                </li>
                <li><b>Other Airports</b>: Apart from Guwahati, Assam has smaller domestic airports in cities like
                    <u>Dibrugarh (Mohanbari Airport)</u>, <u>Jorhat (Rowriah Airport)</u>, <u>Silchar (Kumbhirgram
                        Airport)</u>, and <u>Tezpur (Salonibari Airport)</u>. These airports primarily handle domestic
                    flights connecting Assam to other parts of India.

            <b class="heading">4. Water Transport:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Ferries and Boats</b>: Given the presence of the vast <u>Brahmaputra River</u> and its
                    tributaries,
                    water transport plays a significant role in Assam. Ferries are widely used to transport people and
                    goods, especially in areas like <u>Majuli</u> (the world’s largest river island) and
                    <u>Dhakuakhana</u>.
                    The <u>Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI)</u> operates ferry services along the Brahmaputra
                    and
                    Barak rivers.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ferries are used for both passenger and cargo transport, with services connecting towns
                            along
                            the riverbanks. The ferry system is crucial for connectivity, especially during the monsoon
                            season when road access may be limited.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>River Cruises</b>: In recent years, <u>luxury river cruises</u> have become a popular mode of
                    transport for tourists exploring Assam's natural beauty. These cruises offer scenic views of the
                    Brahmaputra and its surrounding landscapes, often with stops at cultural and historical sites.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="heading">5. Rickshaws and Cycle Transport:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cycle Rickshaws</b>: In smaller towns and rural areas, <u>cycle rickshaws</u> are a common mode
                    of
                    transport for short distances. They are often used to navigate narrow lanes and areas that are not
                    accessible by buses or cars.</li>
                <li><b>Bicycles</b>: Many people, especially in rural areas, use bicycles as an eco-friendly and
                    economical
                    mode of transport. Bicycles are common in towns and villages, where distances between places are
                    short
                    and traffic is less congested.</li>
            </ul>

            <b class="heading">6. Bridges:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Bridges over Brahmaputra</b>: Assam has several important bridges across the Brahmaputra River
                    that
                    facilitate road and rail transport. The <u>Saraighat Bridge</u> near Guwahati is the oldest bridge,
                    connecting the north and south banks of the river. Other notable bridges include the <u>Bogibeel
                        Bridge</u> (the longest rail-cum-road bridge in India) and the <u>Dhola-Sadiya Bridge</u>, which
                    connects Assam to Arunachal Pradesh.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="heading">7. Other Modes:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Cycle Vans and Hand-Pulled Carts</b>: In rural areas, <u>cycle vans</u> (bicycle carts) and
                    <u>hand-pulled carts</u> are used to transport goods. These traditional modes of transport remain
                    vital
                    for local businesses and daily activities in villages and small towns.

            <b class="heading">Conclusion:</b>
            <div>
                Assam’s modes of transport are diverse, reflecting the state's varied geography and economic needs. From
