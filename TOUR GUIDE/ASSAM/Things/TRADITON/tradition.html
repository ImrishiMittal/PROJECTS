                        Assam and is used in traditional rituals, offered as a mark of respect, or worn around the neck

                    <li><b>Sattriya Dance:</b> An Indian classical dance form that originated in the Vaishnavite
                        monasteries
                        (Satras) of Assam, Sattriya was introduced by the saint-scholar Srimanta Sankardeva in the 15th
                        century.
                        This dance is performed as part of Bhakti (devotional) performances in monasteries, and it is

                <b class="heading">4. Arts and Crafts:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Weaving:</b> Weaving is a time-honored tradition in Assam. Almost every household in rural
                        Assam
                        has
                        a loom, and Assamese women take pride in weaving their own clothes. The state is famous for its
                        production of Muga silk, known for its durability and golden sheen, as well as Eri silk and Pat
                        silk.
                    </li>

                    <li><b>Cane and Bamboo Craft:</b> The abundant availability of bamboo and cane in Assam has led to
                        the
                        flourishing of bamboo crafts. Artisans create a wide variety of products, from furniture and
                        baskets
                        to
                        intricately designed decorative items. Jaapi (traditional sun hat) made from bamboo and palm
                        leaves
                        is a
                        symbol of Assamese hospitality and culture.</li>

                        Assamese cultural heritage. These masks are used in religious plays like the Ankiya Naat, a
                        traditional
                        Vaishnavite drama, and are made from materials like bamboo, clay, and cloth.</li>

                        holds a significant place in Assam's religious and cultural life. Sankardeva’s Bhakti Movement
                        led
                        to
                        the establishment of Satras (Vaishnavite monasteries), which became centers for religious,

                        goddess
                        Kamakhya and attracts pilgrims and tourists alike.</li>

                        celebrate
                        their unique festivals and follow age-old customs related to nature worship and ancestor

                        (rice cakes), and dishes made with bamboo shoots, mustard, and herbs. Assamese meals are often
                        served on
                        bell metal plates and bowls, which is a cultural practice in many households.</li>
