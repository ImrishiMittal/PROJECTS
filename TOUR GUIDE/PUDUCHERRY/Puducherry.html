        <div class="size">Puducherry, also known as Pondicherry, is a union territory situated on the southeastern coast of India, bordered by the state of Tamil Nadu. It comprises four unconnected districts: Puducherry (Pondicherry), Karaikal, Yanam, and Mahe. Each district retains its unique charm and cultural influences, reflecting a rich blend of French colonial heritage and traditional Tamil culture.

            The history of Puducherry dates back to the 2nd century CE when it was a part of the Pallava Kingdom. Later, it became a prominent trading hub for the Dutch, Portuguese, English, and eventually the French East India Company. The French established their presence in the region in the 17th century, and Puducherry remained a French colony until it was ceded back to India in 1954. This colonial past is evident in the architecture, cuisine, and lifestyle of the region.

            The capital city, Puducherry, often referred to as Pondicherry, is characterized by its well-preserved French Quarter with tree-lined streets, colonial villas, and vibrant bougainvillea-laden houses. Promenade Beach, one of the most popular attractions, offers a picturesque waterfront promenade dotted with cafes and monuments. The Sri Aurobindo Ashram, founded by Sri Aurobindo and a spiritual retreat for seekers worldwide, is another significant landmark in the city.

            Auroville, an experimental township located just outside Puducherry, embodies the principles of unity, peace, and sustainable living. Founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (known as The Mother), Auroville is a melting pot of cultures and nationalities, promoting communal harmony and spiritual growth through its unique architecture and community practices.

            Karaikal, the second-largest district of Puducherry, has a distinct cultural identity shaped by its historical connections with the Chola and Vijayanagar empires. Yanam, situated in the Godavari delta region of Andhra Pradesh, retains its French colonial charm with quaint streets and colonial buildings. Mahe, located on the west coast of Kerala, is known for its picturesque beaches and a blend of Kerala and French cultures.

            Puducherry's economy primarily revolves around tourism, fishing, and agriculture. The region is known for its production of coconuts, cashew nuts, and various spices. Fishing is a significant livelihood for coastal communities, contributing to the local economy.

        <div class="size">
            In terms of governance, Puducherry has a unique administrative setup with a locally elected legislative assembly and a Lieutenant Governor appointed by the President of India. This arrangement allows for a degree of autonomy while being a part of the Indian union.
        </div>
