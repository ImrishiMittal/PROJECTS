            Historically, West Bengal has played a pivotal role in India's history. The region was a major center for trade and commerce during the British colonial era, and Kolkata served as the capital of British India until 1911. This period left a lasting impact on the city's architecture, culture, and education. Iconic landmarks such as the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, and Indian Museum reflect the colonial legacy and architectural grandeur of Kolkata.
