        <div class="size">West Bengal, located in the eastern part of India, is a state known for its rich cultural heritage, historical significance, and economic importance. Bordered by Bangladesh to the east, and the Indian states of Odisha, Jharkhand, Bihar, Sikkim, and Assam, West Bengal also has a coastline along the Bay of Bengal.

This period left a lasting impact on the city's architecture, culture, and education. Iconic landmarks such as the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, and Indian Museum reflect the colonial legacy and architectural grandeur of Kolkata.
