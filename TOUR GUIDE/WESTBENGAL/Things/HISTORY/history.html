The partition was reversed in 1911 due to widespread protests.</li>
                <li><strong>Bengal and Nationalism</strong>: Bengal was a hotbed of revolutionary activity, with groups like the <strong>Anushilan Samiti</strong> and <strong>Jugantar</strong> leading violent struggles against British rule. <strong>Subhas Chandra Bose</strong>, a prominent leader from Bengal, became a key figure in the Indian freedom movement and founded the <strong>Indian National Army (INA)</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Partition of Bengal (1947)</strong>: The partition of India in 1947 resulted in the division of Bengal along religious lines.

                <li><strong>Land Reforms and Agrarian Changes</strong>: In the post-independence period, West Bengal was a focal point of land reforms.
