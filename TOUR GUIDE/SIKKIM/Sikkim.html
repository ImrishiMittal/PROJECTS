            <h1>SIKKIM</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div class="size">Sikkim, nestled in the eastern Himalayas, is a small yet enchanting state in northeastern India. Despite its compact size, Sikkim boasts a rich tapestry of natural beauty, cultural diversity, and unique historical significance. Bordered by Bhutan to the east, Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north and northeast, Nepal to the west, and the Indian state of West Bengal to the south, Sikkim is geographically and strategically significant.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Sikkim's landscape is characterized by its mountainous terrain, with elevations ranging from 280 meters in the south to over 8,500 meters in the north. The most prominent peak is Kanchenjunga, the third-highest mountain in the world, which holds spiritual significance for the local people and attracts trekkers and mountaineers from around the globe. The state's climate varies from subtropical in the lower regions to alpine in the higher altitudes, fostering a diverse range of flora and fauna.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The history of Sikkim is marked by its establishment as a Buddhist kingdom in the 17th century by Phuntsog Namgyal, the first Chogyal (king) of Sikkim. Buddhism remains a dominant religion in the state, with numerous monasteries, such as Rumtek, Pemayangtse, and Tashiding, serving as important cultural and spiritual centers. The Namgyal dynasty ruled Sikkim until its merger with India in 1975, following a period of political upheaval and a referendum in favor of joining the Indian Union.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Sikkim is renowned for its ethnic diversity, with a population comprising Lepchas, Bhutias, and Nepalis, among others. This multiculturalism is reflected in the state's festivals, languages, and traditions. Losar (Tibetan New Year), Losoong (Sikkimese New Year), and Dasain are some of the major festivals celebrated with fervor, showcasing the harmonious coexistence of different communities.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The state's economy is primarily agrarian, with agriculture and horticulture being vital sectors. Sikkim is famous for its organic farming practices, becoming the first fully organic state in India in 2016. Cardamom, ginger, oranges, and tea are some of the key agricultural products. Tourism also plays a crucial role in Sikkim's economy, with visitors drawn to its serene landscapes, adventure sports, and cultural heritage.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Sikkim's cuisine is a delightful blend of flavors influenced by its ethnic diversity. Popular dishes include momos (dumplings), gundruk (fermented leafy greens), and phagshapa (pork with radishes). These dishes reflect the interplay of Nepalese, Tibetan, and local Sikkimese culinary traditions.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In terms of governance, Sikkim has made significant strides in education, healthcare, and infrastructure under the leadership of its state government. Gangtok, the capital city, serves as the political, economic, and cultural hub of the state, offering modern amenities while retaining its traditional charm.
