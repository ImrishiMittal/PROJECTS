                    lungi. The <b>kurta</b> is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved garment made from cotton, well-suited for
                    the tropical climate.</li>
                <li><b>Headgear</b>: Traditional headgear like <b>pagri</b> (turban) is worn by men during special

                    other important events. These sarees are often embellished with traditional designs and gold
                    embroidery.</li>
