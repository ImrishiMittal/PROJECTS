        <div class="size">Chandigarh, the capital of the northern Indian states of Punjab and Haryana, is a city renowned for its unique architectural design and urban planning. Established in the 1950s, it represents a bold vision of modern India, conceived and executed under the guidance of Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier. The city is named after the Hindu goddess Chandi, whose temple is a short distance from the city.

        <div class="size">
            One of the most striking features of Chandigarh is its meticulously planned layout. The city is divided into sectors, each designed to be self-sufficient units with their own markets, schools, and recreational areas. The road network is a grid pattern, facilitating smooth traffic flow and reducing congestion. This well-organized urban plan has earned Chandigarh the moniker of "The City Beautiful."

        <div class="size">
            Le Corbusier's architectural philosophy is evident throughout Chandigarh. His vision emphasized open spaces, greenery, and an interplay between built and natural environments. The Capitol Complex, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the centerpiece of his work in the city. It houses the Secretariat, the Legislative Assembly, and the High Court, all exemplifying his modernist principles with stark, geometric forms and extensive use of concrete.

        <div class="size">
            Apart from its architectural significance, Chandigarh is also a city of gardens. The Rock Garden, created by Nek Chand, is a marvel of recycled art, featuring sculptures made from industrial and urban waste. The Sukhna Lake, an artificial reservoir at the foot of the Himalayas, is a popular spot for picnics, boating, and evening strolls. The Rose Garden, Asia's largest of its kind, boasts thousands of rose varieties, attracting visitors during its annual festival.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Chandigarh's socio-economic landscape is equally impressive. It has one of the highest per capita incomes in India and is known for its high standard of living. The city is a hub for education and research, with institutions like Panjab University, the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), and various technology and management schools.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Culturally, Chandigarh is a melting pot, reflecting the diversity of India. Its population comprises people from different parts of the country, contributing to a vibrant cultural scene with festivals, art exhibitions, and theatre performances. The city's markets, especially Sector 17 Plaza, are bustling centers for shopping and socializing.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In essence, Chandigarh is a city that harmoniously blends modernity with tradition. Its design and development are a testament to visionary urban planning, making it a model for other cities. The city's emphasis on greenery, public spaces, and cultural inclusivity continues to make it one of India's most livable cities.
