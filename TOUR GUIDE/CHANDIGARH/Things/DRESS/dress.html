            <b>Traditional and Modern Attire of Chandigarh</b>
            <p>
                The traditional dress of Chandigarh is influenced primarily by the cultural roots of Punjab and Haryana,
                as the city serves as the capital for both states. Although modern Western clothing is popular in
                everyday life, traditional attire is especially prominent during festivals, weddings, and other cultural
                events. Here's an overview of the traditional dress seen in Chandigarh:

        <div>
            <b>For Women:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Salwar Kameez:</b>
                    <p>The most common traditional attire, especially influenced by Punjabi culture. Women wear vibrant
                        colors and intricate embroidery, such as phulkari work. The <i>Patiala salwar</i>, with its
                        pleats and loose fit, is a popular style.</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Churidar and Kurta:</b>
                    <p>A variation of the salwar kameez with tighter, wrinkle-gathered trousers at the ankle, often worn
                        on formal occasions or during festivals.</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Lehenga:</b>
                    <p>For weddings and festivals, women wear the lehenga, a pleated skirt paired with a blouse and
                        dupatta, often richly embroidered with sequins and zari.</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Phulkari Dupatta:</b>
                    <p>A vibrant, heavily embroidered dupatta, symbolizing Punjabi cultural heritage, often paired with
                        simple salwar kameez to add a festive touch.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <b>For Men:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Kurta-Pyjama:</b>
                    <p>A staple traditional outfit for men, consisting of a long tunic (kurta) and loose-fitting
                        trousers (pyjama), often made of cotton or silk. For special occasions, luxurious fabrics with
                        detailed embroidery are common.</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Sherwani:</b>
                    <p>Worn during formal events or weddings, a sherwani is a long, coat-like garment made of rich
                        fabrics like silk or brocade, paired with churidar or trousers. The outfit is often complemented
                        with a safa (turban).</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Turban (Pagri):</b>
                    <p>An essential part of traditional attire for Sikh men, symbolizing both cultural and religious
                        significance. Turbans in various colors and styles are often paired with kurta-pyjama or
                        sherwani.</p>
                </li>

                <li><b>Pathani Suit:</b>
                    <p>A long kurta paired with loose salwar or pyjama, commonly worn for casual or semi-formal events.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b>Modern Fashion Influence:</b>
            <p>
                Chandigarh, being a modern city, has a thriving fashion scene. While traditional wear is common during
                festivals and cultural events, people—particularly the youth—often wear contemporary Western clothing
                such as jeans, T-shirts, dresses, and suits. Popular markets like Sector 17 and Elante Mall offer a
                variety of both modern and traditional fashion choices.
