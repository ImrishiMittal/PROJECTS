    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <div class="big">
        The history of Chandigarh is a fascinating narrative that intertwines the colonial era, post-independence
        challenges, and modern urban development. Here’s an overview of the significant milestones in Chandigarh’s
        history:
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">1. Pre-Colonial Period</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Before the British colonization</b>, the region where Chandigarh now stands was part of the
                historical territories of the <b>Punjab region</b>. It was predominantly agrarian, inhabited by various
                communities.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">2. Colonial Era</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>In the early 20th century</b>, the British established <b>Chandigarh</b> as a small town in the
                Punjab province. The town was not initially significant and served as a military outpost and
                administrative center.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">3. Partition of India (1947)</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The turning point in Chandigarh’s history</b> came with the <b>Partition of India</b> in 1947. The
                partition led to significant political and demographic changes, with Lahore (the then capital of Punjab)
                becoming part of Pakistan. This necessitated the creation of a new capital for the Indian state of
                Punjab.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">4. Planning and Development</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>The Indian government</b>, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister <b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b>,
                sought to build a modern capital that reflected the aspirations of a newly independent nation.</li>
            <li><b>In 1950</b>, the French architect <b>Le Corbusier</b> was appointed as the chief architect of
                Chandigarh. He envisioned the city as a model of modern urbanism, emphasizing functionality, green
                spaces, and architectural harmony.</li>
            <li><b>Le Corbusier, along with his team</b>, designed the city’s layout, including its sectors, roads, and
                prominent buildings. The city was planned in a grid pattern with sectors, each serving as self-contained
                neighborhoods.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">5. Inauguration and Urban Development</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chandigarh was officially inaugurated</b> as the capital of Punjab in <b>1953</b>. The first phase of
                development focused on basic infrastructure, government buildings, and residential areas.</li>
            <li><b>Over the years, Chandigarh grew rapidly</b>, attracting people from various states due to its modern
                amenities and job opportunities. It became a symbol of modernity and urban planning in India.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">6. Union Territory</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>In 1966</b>, the state of Punjab was reorganized, and Haryana was carved out as a separate state.
                Chandigarh was declared a <b>Union Territory</b>, serving as the joint capital of both Punjab and
                Haryana.</li>
        </ul>
