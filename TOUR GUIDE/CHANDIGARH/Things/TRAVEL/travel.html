                    various parts of the city and connecting it to nearby regions. The buses are affordable and a
                    popular mode of transportation for daily commuters.</li>
                <li><b>Auto Rickshaws</b>: These are widely used for short distances within the city. They are a
                    convenient and economical option for locals and tourists alike.</li>

                    Chandigarh to various major cities in India, including Delhi, Mumbai, and Amritsar. It offers a
                    range of train services, including express and local trains.</li>

                    an important domestic airport that connects the city to several major cities across India. The
                    airport offers both passenger and cargo services.</li>
