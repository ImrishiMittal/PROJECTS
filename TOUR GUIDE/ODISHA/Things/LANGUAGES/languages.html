            <b class="heading">Conclusion</b>
            <p><strong>Odia</strong> is the heart and soul of Odisha's cultural and linguistic identity, but the state is also home to a diverse range of languages due to its complex geography and varied communities. While <strong>Hindi</strong> and <strong>English</strong> are widely used for communication, the tribal languages of Odisha add a unique linguistic richness, reflecting the state’s cultural diversity. As the state modernizes, maintaining the balance between the dominant <strong>Odia</strong> language and the linguistic needs of its tribal populations remains an important aspect of preserving its heritage.</p>
