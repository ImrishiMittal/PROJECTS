            <div class="size">Odisha, formerly known as Orissa, is a state located on the eastern coast of India,
                bordered by the Bay of Bengal to the east. It is renowned for its rich cultural heritage, historical
                significance, and diverse natural landscapes. The state's capital is Bhubaneswar, which is known as the
                "Temple City of India" due to its numerous ancient temples, including the Lingaraj Temple, a fine
                example of Kalinga architecture.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                Historically, Odisha has a rich legacy dating back to ancient times. It was the site of the famous
                Kalinga War in 261 BCE, which played a crucial role in the transformation of Emperor Ashoka from a
                warrior to a pacifist and a patron of Buddhism. The state's history is marked by various dynasties,
                including the Kalinga, Maurya, and Gupta empires, each contributing to its cultural and architectural
                heritage.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                The state is also famous for its vibrant festivals, with Rath Yatra being the most notable. Held
                annually in Puri, this grand chariot festival attracts millions of devotees from across the globe. The
                Sun Temple at Konark, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is another architectural marvel that reflects the
                state's glorious past.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                Odisha's natural beauty is equally captivating, featuring a diverse range of landscapes from coastal
                plains to lush forests and rolling hills. The state is home to several wildlife sanctuaries and national
                parks, such as Simlipal National Park and Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, which harbor a variety of
                flora and fauna, including tigers, elephants, and the endangered saltwater crocodile.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                The state's economy is primarily driven by agriculture, with rice being the staple crop. Odisha is also
                rich in minerals and has a significant mining industry, producing coal, iron ore, bauxite, and chromite.
                The industrial sector has seen substantial growth with the establishment of numerous steel plants,
                aluminum factories, and other manufacturing units.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                Odisha's coastline extends for about 485 kilometers, providing ample opportunities for fishing and
                maritime activities. Chilika Lake, the largest coastal lagoon in India, is a vital hotspot for
                biodiversity and a haven for migratory birds, making it a popular destination for bird watchers and
                nature enthusiasts.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                The state has made significant strides in education and healthcare, with institutions like the Indian
                Institute of Technology (IIT) Bhubaneswar and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS)
                Bhubaneswar contributing to higher education and medical research.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                Odisha's art and craft heritage is renowned, with Pattachitra (traditional cloth-based scroll painting),
                silver filigree work, and appliqu√© crafts from Pipili being particularly famous. The state's classical
                dance form, Odissi, is one of the oldest surviving dance forms in India and is celebrated worldwide for
                its grace and expressiveness.
            </div>
            <div class="size">
                In summary, Odisha is a state that harmoniously blends its ancient heritage with modern progress,
                offering a rich tapestry of culture, history, and natural beauty. Its contributions to India's cultural
                and economic landscape make it a unique and significant part of the country.
