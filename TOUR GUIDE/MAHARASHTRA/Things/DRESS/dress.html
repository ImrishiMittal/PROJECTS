            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nauvari Saree (Nine-Yard Saree)</strong>: The most iconic attire for women in Maharashtra is the Nauvari saree, a nine-yard-long saree worn without a petticoat, allowing it to be draped in a dhoti-style manner. This saree is practical for daily chores and was traditionally worn by female warriors, providing ease of movement. The drape is unique, with one end covering the shoulder (pallu) and pleats often tucked at the back, resembling a trouser-like fit.</li>
                <li><strong>Color and Fabrics</strong>: Women often prefer bright colors like green, red, and gold for special occasions, weddings, and festivals. Fabrics can range from cotton for daily wear to silk for special occasions.</li>
                <li><strong>Jewelry</strong>: Traditional Maharashtrian jewelry includes the famous <i>nath</i> (nose ring), <i>mangalsutra</i> (marriage necklace), <i>bangles</i>, and <i>kamarpatta</i> (waist belt). Pearl and gold jewelry often have intricate designs.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessories</strong>: The hair is commonly adorned with <i>gajras</i> (flower garlands), and women may also wear <i>bindi</i> and <i>kohl</i> for their eyes.</li>

                <li><strong>Pheta (Turban)</strong>: The <i>pheta</i> is a characteristic headgear that symbolizes honor and pride.
