    <h1>TRADITION</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <i>Traditions of Indian Punjab</i> are deeply rooted in its history, culture, and religious practices. The region's vibrant customs reflect a unique blend of <strong>Sikh</strong>, <strong>Hindu</strong>, and <strong>Muslim</strong> influences, with a focus on <i>community</i>, <i>family values</i>, and a rich cultural heritage. Here are some key traditional aspects of <strong>Punjab</strong>:

        <div>
            <b class="heading"><i>1. Family and Social Structure</i></b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Patriarchal Society</strong>: Traditionally, Punjabi society has been <strong>patriarchal</strong>, with the <strong>elders</strong> (especially the father) often holding the primary decision-making authority within the family.</li>
                <li><strong>Joint Families</strong>: Although nuclear families are becoming more common, many Punjabi families continue to live in <strong>joint families</strong>, where extended families—parents, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins—live together under one roof. This structure fosters a strong sense of <i>community</i> and <i>support</i>.</li>
                <li><strong>Respect for Elders</strong>: Respect for elders is an important tradition. Elders are revered for their wisdom and experience, and their opinions often guide family decisions. Younger people greet elders with a respectful gesture called "charan sparsh" (touching their feet).</li>
