            <div class="size">Punjab is a state located in the northern part of India, known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and significant contributions to the country's economy and agrarian society. The name "Punjab" is derived from the Persian words "panj" (five) and "aab" (water), referring to the five rivers that originally flowed through this region: Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej. These rivers make Punjab one of the most fertile regions in India, often referred to as the "Granary of India" or "India's Bread-Basket."
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The state has a unique historical and cultural significance. Punjab's history dates back to ancient times, being part of the Indus Valley Civilization. It has seen numerous invasions and migrations over the centuries, including those by the Aryans, Persians, Greeks, Mughals, and British. This diverse history has shaped Punjab into a melting pot of various cultures and traditions. The Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest shrine in Sikhism, is one of Punjab's most iconic landmarks and a major pilgrimage site.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Punjab's culture is characterized by its music, dance, and festivals. Bhangra and Gidda are the most popular traditional dances, often performed during celebrations and festivals like Vaisakhi, which marks the Punjabi New Year and the harvest season. Punjabi music, with its upbeat and energetic rhythms, has gained international acclaim, with artists like Gurdas Maan, Diljit Dosanjh, and many others bringing Punjabi folk and pop music to the global stage.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Agriculture is the backbone of Punjab's economy, with the state being a major producer of wheat, rice, sugarcane, and various fruits and vegetables. The Green Revolution in the 1960s, which introduced high-yielding varieties of seeds and modern agricultural techniques, significantly boosted Punjab's agricultural output and transformed its rural landscape. However, this has also led to challenges such as groundwater depletion and the need for sustainable farming practices.

        <div class="size">
            The people of Punjab are known for their warmth, hospitality, and strong sense of community. Punjabi cuisine, known for its rich and hearty flavors, includes dishes like butter chicken, sarson da saag with makki di roti, and an array of dairy products such as paneer and lassi.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In addition to agriculture, Punjab has made strides in industries like textiles, manufacturing, and information technology. The state capital, Chandigarh, designed by the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier, is a modern city known for its urban planning and architecture.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Overall, Punjab is a land of dynamic contrasts, blending ancient traditions with modernity. Its contributions to India's culture, economy, and society are immense, making it a significant and cherished part of the nation.
