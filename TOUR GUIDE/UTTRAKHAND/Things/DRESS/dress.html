                <li><strong>Kumaoni Dress</strong>: In the Kumaon region, women traditionally wear a <i>pichora</i>, which is a long, flowing garment, along with a <i>choli</i> and a <i>dupatta</i>. They also wear distinctive jewelry, including <i>necklaces</i> and <i>earrings</i> made of silver and beads.</li>

        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Men’s Dress</b>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Everyday Clothing</strong>: While traditional attire is worn during festivals and special occasions, everyday clothing has been influenced by modern fashion. Many people now opt for casual Western wear, especially in urban areas.</li>
            </ul>
