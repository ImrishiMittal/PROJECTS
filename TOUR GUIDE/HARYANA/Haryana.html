        <h1>HARYANA</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="size">
        <div>Haryana, a state in northern India, was carved out of the former state of Punjab on November 1, 1966. Its creation was based on linguistic lines to ensure that Hindi-speaking populations had their own state. Haryana is bordered by Punjab and Himachal Pradesh to the north, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh to the east, Rajasthan to the south, and shares a western boundary with Delhi, the national capital.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The state's geography is primarily a fertile plain, interspersed with rivers such as the Yamuna. This advantageous landscape has made agriculture the backbone of Haryana's economy. Crops like wheat, rice, sugarcane, and cotton dominate the agricultural sector, making the state one of India's largest contributors to the national granary.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Haryana has made significant strides in industrial development, particularly in the automobile and information technology sectors. Gurgaon, now officially named Gurugram, is a major IT and automobile hub, hosting numerous multinational corporations and manufacturing plants. This rapid industrialization has significantly boosted Haryanaâ€™s economy, making it one of India's wealthier states in terms of per capita income.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Culturally, Haryana boasts a rich heritage with a blend of traditional and contemporary influences. The state is known for its vibrant folk music, dance, and festivals such as Teej and Baisakhi. The local cuisine, dominated by dairy products and a variety of bread, reflects the agrarian lifestyle of its people.
        </div>
        <div>
            Haryana's contribution to sports is noteworthy, with the state producing many national and international level athletes, particularly in wrestling, boxing, and hockey. The government has invested heavily in sports infrastructure and training facilities, further nurturing this talent.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Education in Haryana has also seen remarkable improvements, with the establishment of numerous schools, colleges, and universities. Efforts to promote literacy and higher education have resulted in significant increases in literacy rates over the past few decades.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In summary, Haryana represents a unique blend of traditional values and modernity, underpinned by a strong agricultural base, burgeoning industrial sector, and a rich cultural tapestry. Its strategic location, dynamic economy, and progressive governance make it a key player in India's socio-economic landscape.
