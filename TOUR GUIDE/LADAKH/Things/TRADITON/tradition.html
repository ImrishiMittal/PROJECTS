    <h1>TRADITION</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <div>
            <p>The traditions of Ladakh are deeply rooted in its unique cultural heritage, influenced by Tibetan
                Buddhism,
                its geographical isolation, and its historical connection with Central Asia. Ladakhi traditions
                encompass
                various aspects of daily life, including religion, customs, art, festivals, and social practices. The
                region's traditions have evolved over centuries, shaped by its harsh environment, which has instilled a
                strong sense of community, self-reliance, and reverence for nature.</p>
