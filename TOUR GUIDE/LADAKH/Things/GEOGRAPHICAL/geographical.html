            Ladakh is a high-altitude region located in the northernmost part of India, in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. It is bordered by China (Tibet) to the east, Pakistan to the west, and the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab to the south. The region lies in the rain shadow of the mighty Himalayas, which makes it a desert-like area, characterized by rugged mountains, deep valleys, and a cold desert climate.
