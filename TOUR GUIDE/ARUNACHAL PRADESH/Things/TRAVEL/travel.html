        <div>
            Arunachal Pradesh, due to its rugged terrain and remote location, has a variety of transportation modes that
            cater to the needs of both residents and tourists. While the state’s infrastructure is improving, its
            mountainous landscape presents challenges, making some regions more accessible than others. The major modes
            of transport in Arunachal Pradesh include roadways, airways, and limited waterways. Here is an overview of
            the transportation options:

                    <b class="head"> 1. Roadways:</b>
                    Roadways are the primary mode of transportation in Arunachal Pradesh, connecting most major towns
                    and cities. However, the terrain is mountainous, and road conditions can vary, especially during the
                    monsoon season when landslides are common. Despite these challenges, roads have improved over the
                    years, making travel more accessible.

                <div>
                    <b> National Highways</b>: Arunachal Pradesh is connected to Assam and other neighboring states
                    through a network of national highways. The <u>NH-13</u>, also known as the <u>Trans-Arunachal
                        Highway</u>, is the state’s main road artery, running across the state and connecting major
                    towns like Itanagar, Ziro, Bomdila, and Tawang.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b> State Highways and Rural Roads</b>: Various state highways and rural roads link smaller
                    towns and villages to major cities and districts. These roads are essential for the local
                    population, although their condition can sometimes be challenging due to the remote locations and
                    steep terrains.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b> Public Transport</b>: Public transport in Arunachal Pradesh primarily consists of buses and
                    shared taxis. The <u>Arunachal Pradesh State Transport Services (APSTS)</u> operates bus
                    services connecting major towns like Itanagar, Tawang, Ziro, Bomdila, and Pasighat with neighboring
                    Assam. Private operators also run mini-buses and shared taxis, which are commonly used for
                    inter-town travel.

                <b class="head"> 2. Airways:</b>
                <div>
                    Air travel is an increasingly popular option for reaching remote parts of Arunachal Pradesh, especially
                    for tourists and officials. Although there is no fully operational commercial airport within the state,
                    there are several nearby airports in Assam and a few airstrips in Arunachal Pradesh.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <b> Tezu Airport</b>: Located in the Lohit district, Tezu Airport is the only operational airport in
                        Arunachal Pradesh that offers commercial flights. It connects the region with cities like Guwahati and
                        Dibrugarh in Assam.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b> Pasighat Airport:</b> Pasighat Airport offers limited flights and is another point of air access to
                        the state. It connects primarily to the rest of the northeast and is being developed for better air
                        connectivity.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Helicopter Services</b>: Helicopter services are available between some remote locations, especially
                        where road access is limited or time-consuming. Pawan Hans operates these services, which are
                        particularly useful for reaching places like Tawang, Anini, and Ziro.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b> Nearby Airports:</b> Major air travel to Arunachal Pradesh is generally routed through nearby airports
                        in Assam, such as <u>Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport</u> in Guwahati and <u>Dibrugarh
                            Airport</u>, both of which provide regular flights to major cities across India. From these airports,
                            tourists and travelers can take road transport to Arunachal Pradesh.

            <div>
                <b class="head"> 3. Railways:</b>
                Arunachal Pradesh has limited railway connectivity due to its mountainous terrain, but efforts are being
                made to improve this mode of transport.
                <div>
                    <b> Naharlagun Railway Station</b>: Located near the capital, Itanagar, Naharlagun Railway Station is the
                    first and only broad-gauge railway station in the state. It connects to Guwahati and New Delhi via the
                    <u>Naharlagun-Guwahati Intercity Express</u> and the <u>Naharlagun-New Delhi AC Express</u>, respectively.
                    These trains make it easier for travelers to reach Arunachal Pradesh from other parts of the country.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b> Future Railway Projects</b>: The Indian government is working on extending rail connectivity to more
                    parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Proposed projects include extending railway lines to Tawang and other remote
                    areas, which would greatly enhance accessibility.

            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <b class="head"> 4. Waterways:</b>
                    Although not a common mode of transport in Arunachal Pradesh, waterways do play a role in some areas,
                    especially along the Brahmaputra River and its tributaries. The state has numerous rivers, but most are
                    not navigable due to their swift currents and hilly terrain. However, in the foothill regions and plains
                    bordering Assam, rivers are used for local transport and trade.
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b> Ferry Services</b>: In some areas, small ferries and boats operate along the rivers, primarily to
                    transport goods and people. These services are more common in the lower foothills and bordering regions
                    where rivers like the Siang, Lohit, and Subansiri flow.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <b class="head"> 5. Trekking and Footpaths:</b>
                Due to the state’s mountainous and forested regions, trekking is often a mode of transport in remote and
                inaccessible areas. Many villages and smaller communities are connected only by footpaths or narrow
                trails. For adventure travelers and locals, trekking through these regions is a practical and popular
                way to navigate the difficult terrain. Popular trekking routes in places like Tawang, Mechuka, and Ziro
                are also major tourist attractions.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="head"> Conclusion:</b>
            While roadways remain the dominant mode of transportation in Arunachal Pradesh, airways, railways, and even
            waterways are gradually being improved to make the state more accessible. The challenging terrain adds a
            sense of adventure to travel within the region, making the journey part of the experience for those visiting
            Arunachal Pradesh.
