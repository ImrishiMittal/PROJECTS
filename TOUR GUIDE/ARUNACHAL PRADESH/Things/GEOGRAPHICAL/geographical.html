    <h1>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <div>
            Arunachal Pradesh, often referred to as the "Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains," is located in the northeastern
            part of India. It is the largest state in the northeastern region, both in terms of area and the diversity
            of its geography. Bordered by international boundaries with <u>Bhutan to the west</u>,<u> China (Tibet) to
                the north and northeast</u>, and <u>Myanmar to the east</u>, the state occupies a strategic and
            significant geographic position. The southern part of Arunachal Pradesh shares its boundaries with the
            Indian states of <u>Assam</u> and <u>Nagaland</u>.

            <b class="head"> Latitude and Longitude:</b> <br>
            The geographic coordinates of Arunachal Pradesh lie between <u>26.28° N to 29.30° N latitude</u> and
            <u>91.20° E to 97.30° E longitude</u>. Its northernmost areas are marked by high Himalayan mountain ranges,
            while the southern regions gradually transition into the plains of Assam.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="head"> Topography:</b> <br>
            Arunachal Pradesh's terrain is predominantly mountainous, with the eastern Himalayan range extending
            throughout the state. The state can be broadly categorized into the following topographical zones:
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>The Himalayan Range</b>: The northernmost part of Arunachal Pradesh, adjacent to Tibet,
                        consists of lofty snow-capped mountains, including peaks like <u>Kangto</u> and <u>Gorichen</u>,
                        which exceed 7,000 meters in elevation. These regions experience harsh climatic conditions and
                        are often inaccessible during winter due to heavy snowfall.</li>

                    <li><b>Sub-Himalayan Hills</b>: In the central part of the state, the elevation ranges between 1,500
                        to 3,500 meters, with lush green valleys, rivers, and forests. This region includes popular
                        tourist destinations like <u>Tawang</u>, <u>Bomdila</u>, and <u>Ziro Valley</u>.</li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Foothills and Plains</b>: The southern areas, bordering Assam, gradually slope down to the
                        plains. The Siang, Subansiri, Kameng, and Lohit rivers flow through these foothill regions,
                        creating fertile plains that are suitable for agriculture.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            </div>
            <b class="head"> Rivers:</b> <br>
            Arunachal Pradesh is home to numerous rivers that originate from the glaciers and mountains of the
            Himalayas. These rivers flow southwards, eventually joining the Brahmaputra River in Assam. The key rivers
            in the state include:
            <ul>
                <li><b> Siang River</b>: Known as the Tsangpo in Tibet, it becomes the Brahmaputra in Assam after
                    merging with other tributaries.</li>
                <li><b>Subansiri River</b>: A major tributary of the Brahmaputra, it is the largest river in Arunachal
                    Pradesh.</li>
                <li><b>Kameng River</b>: Another important river in the western part of the state.</li>
                <li><b>Lohit River</b>: Flowing from eastern Arunachal Pradesh, it merges with the Brahmaputra in Assam.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="head"> Climate:</b> <br>
            Arunachal Pradesh has a wide range of climatic conditions due to its varied topography. In the high-altitude
            northern and central regions, the climate is alpine with heavy snowfall during winter. The central valleys
            experience a temperate climate with cool summers and cold winters. The southern foothills and plains have a
            subtropical climate with hot summers, mild winters, and high humidity during the monsoon season.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="head"> Biodiversity:</b> <br>
            Arunachal Pradesh is renowned for its rich biodiversity, owing to its varied geographical conditions. The
            state has dense forests, which cover more than 80% of its area, and is part of the Eastern Himalayan
            biodiversity hotspot. It is home to numerous species of flora and fauna, including many endemic species.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b class="head"> Conclusion:</b> <br>
            Arunachal Pradesh’s geographic location, with its borders adjoining international countries, its mountainous
            terrain, and river systems, makes it a unique state in India. Its remote and rugged geography is a major
            factor in both its beauty and challenges, while its location along the Indo-Tibetan border makes it of
            strategic importance to India.
