            <p>
                Lakshadweep is an archipelago of 36 islands located in the <i>Arabian Sea</i>, off the southwestern coast of India. The islands are spread over an area of about <i>30,000 square miles</i> in the Arabian Sea, though the land area is only around <i>30 square kilometers</i>. It lies approximately <i>200 to 400 kilometers</i> off the coast of Kerala, India, making it the smallest Union Territory of India both in terms of area and population.
            </p>
            <p>
                The islands of Lakshadweep are located between <i>8째 and 12째 North latitude</i> and <i>71째 and 74째 East longitude</i>. The archipelago is positioned strategically along important maritime routes in the Indian Ocean, making it an important location for both historical trade and modern maritime navigation.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Coral Atolls and Reefs</strong>: The islands of Lakshadweep are primarily coral atolls, with lagoons and coral reefs surrounding them. These reefs are rich in marine biodiversity, including a wide variety of <i>fish</i>, <i>turtles</i>, and <i>coral species</i>, making it an important ecological area.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Low Elevation</strong>: Most of the islands in Lakshadweep are relatively flat and low-lying, with the highest point being only about <i>4.5 meters (15 feet)</i> above sea level. This makes the islands particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels caused by climate change.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
