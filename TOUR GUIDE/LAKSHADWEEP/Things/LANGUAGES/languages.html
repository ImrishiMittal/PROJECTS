        <b class="heading">Languages of Lakshadweep:</b>
        <p>
            Lakshadweep, being an isolated archipelago, has a unique linguistic landscape. The primary language spoken in the islands is <strong>Malayalam</strong>, which is the official language of the Union Territory. However, due to the islands' diverse cultural and historical influences, several other languages are also spoken by the local population.
        </p>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">1. Malayalam</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Malayalam</strong> is the dominant language spoken by the people of Lakshadweep, especially in the more populated islands like <em>Kavaratti</em> and <em>Agatti</em>. The language has its roots in the <em>Dravidian family</em> and is the official language of <em>Kerala</em>, the neighboring state on the mainland. The influence of Malayalam is so strong that most of the administration and education in the region is conducted in Malayalam.</li>
                <li>It is widely used for communication, cultural practices, and government functions. The writing script for Malayalam is also used on the islands.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Mahl</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mahl</strong> is another important language in Lakshadweep, especially on the island of <em>Minicoy</em>, the southernmost part of the archipelago. The language belongs to the <em>Indo-Aryan family</em> and is closely related to the <em>Dhivehi</em> language spoken in the nearby Maldives.</li>
                <li>Mahl is a blend of <em>Tibeto-Burman</em>, <em>Dravidian</em>, and <em>Arabic</em> influences. The people of Minicoy traditionally speak Mahl in their daily life and cultural activities, though the younger generation is also familiar with Malayalam and English.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">3. English</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>English</strong> is widely used in administrative, legal, and educational contexts in Lakshadweep. It is the second language for many of the islanders, especially in more urbanized areas. English is commonly spoken among government officials, tourists, and in educational institutions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">4. Other Languages</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to the influence of surrounding coastal regions and historical maritime trade, <strong>Hindi</strong> and <em>Tamil</em> are also understood and occasionally spoken by some of the local populations, though they are not as prevalent as Malayalam or Mahl.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>
            In summary, while <strong>Malayalam</strong> serves as the most widely spoken and administrative language of Lakshadweep, <strong>Mahl</strong> holds cultural significance, especially on the island of Minicoy. <strong>English</strong> also plays a significant role in governance, education, and communication with outsiders.
