        <div>
            <div class="size">Delhi, the capital city of India, is a vibrant metropolis that seamlessly blends the ancient with the modern. It is one of the oldest cities in the world, with a rich history that dates back over 2,000 years. This sprawling city is not only the political hub of India but also a melting pot of diverse cultures, traditions, and lifestyles.

            One of Delhi's most notable features is its historical significance. The city is dotted with numerous monuments, each telling a story of its glorious past. The Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a testament to the grandeur of the Mughal era. Built in the mid-17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan, this massive fort complex is a symbol of India's rich history. Nearby, the Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, showcases the architectural brilliance of the Mughals.

It stands as a symbol of the city's Islamic heritage. The Humayun's Tomb, a precursor to the Taj Mahal, is another architectural marvel that reflects Delhi's historical depth.

            Delhi is also the seat of the Indian government, housing important political landmarks such as the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of the President of India, and the Parliament House. The India Gate, a war memorial, stands proudly as a tribute to Indian soldiers who died in World War I.
