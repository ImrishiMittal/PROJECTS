        <div class="size">Meghalaya, meaning "abode of clouds" in Sanskrit, is a picturesque state located in northeastern India. It is renowned for its diverse culture, rich history, and breathtaking natural beauty. Meghalaya was formed on January 21, 1972, when it was carved out of Assam. The state is bordered by Assam to the north and east and shares an international border with Bangladesh to the south and west.

            One of the most captivating features of Meghalaya is its varied landscape, which includes lush green hills, dense forests, and numerous rivers and waterfalls. The state is part of the Meghalaya Plateau, and its terrain is predominantly hilly. The Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo hills are the primary hill ranges in the state, each named after the major tribes inhabiting these regions.

            Shillong, the capital city, is often referred to as the "Scotland of the East" due to its scenic beauty and pleasant climate. It is a cultural hub and houses several colonial-era buildings, museums, and parks. The Don Bosco Centre for Indigenous Cultures in Shillong offers a deep insight into the diverse cultures of northeastern India. Another popular attraction is the Umiam Lake, a serene man-made reservoir located just north of the city.

            Cherrapunji and Mawsynram, both located in Meghalaya, are among the wettest places on Earth. These regions receive extraordinary amounts of rainfall, creating stunning landscapes adorned with vibrant flora and unique living root bridges. These bridges are made by training the roots of rubber trees to grow across streams and rivers, forming natural, sturdy structures that have been used by locals for centuries.

            Meghalaya is also home to a rich tapestry of cultures and traditions. The Khasi, Jaintia, and Garo tribes dominate the population, each with their distinct language, customs, and festivals. The state's matrilineal society is particularly noteworthy, where lineage and inheritance are traced through the female line. Festivals like Nongkrem Dance, Shad Suk Mynsiem, and Wangala are celebrated with great fervor, showcasing the vibrant traditions and cultural heritage of the state.

The state is known for its production of crops like rice, maize, and potatoes, as well as fruits like oranges and pineapples. Additionally, Meghalaya has significant mineral resources, including coal, limestone, and uranium.

            Tourism plays a crucial role in Meghalaya's economy, drawing visitors with its natural beauty and cultural richness. Adventure tourism, including trekking, caving, and rock climbing, is particularly popular due to the state's rugged terrain and extensive cave systems, such as the Siju and Mawsmai caves.
