            <b class="heading">Transportation in Meghalaya</b>

            Meghalaya, with its hilly terrain and diverse geography, has a mix of transportation modes for getting
            around the state. The transportation system is developing to meet the needs of the people while showcasing
            the state's scenic beauty. Here are the primary modes of transport in Meghalaya:
        </div>
        <div>

            <b class="heading">1. Road Transport</b>

            <b>National Highways and State Roads</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Meghalaya has a fairly developed road network connecting major cities and towns within the state.
                    The main highways, such as National Highway 6 and National Highway 40, connect the state with
                    neighboring states like Assam, Bengal, and more distant parts of India.</li>
                <li>The state also has well-maintained state roads that connect the hilly towns and remote villages.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <b>Buses</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Private Buses</strong>: Various private bus operators run services between Shillong, the
                    capital, and other towns like Tura, Jowai, and Nongstoin. These buses serve as the most common mode
                    of transport for intercity travel within Meghalaya.</li>
                <li><strong>Government Buses</strong>: The Meghalaya Transport Corporation (MTC) also runs buses, which
                    are a more affordable but less frequent option. MTC buses connect major urban centers within
                    Meghalaya as well as neighboring states.</li>
            </ul>

            <b>Taxis and Shared Vehicles</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxis</strong>: Private taxis are commonly used for intercity and local travel. They can be
                    hired for both short and long distances.</li>
                <li><strong>Shared Taxis</strong>: For shorter trips, shared taxis (locally known as "Sumos") are
                    commonly used. These taxis are usually shared by multiple passengers and can be more economical.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">2. Rail Transport</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Meghalaya does not have its own railway network, but the nearest major railway stations are located
                    in <strong>Guwahati</strong> (Assam), which is around 100-120 kilometers from Shillong. From there,
                    travelers can take a taxi or bus to reach Meghalaya.</li>
                <li><strong>Nongstoin</strong> in West Khasi Hills is expected to get a railway station soon as part of
                    ongoing infrastructure development plans.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">3. Air Transport</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shillong Airport</strong> (Umroi) is the main airport in Meghalaya, located about 30 km from
                    Shillong, the capital city. It has limited flight services, primarily connecting to Guwahati and
                    Kolkata. However, the airport's capacity is being expanded to handle more flights.</li>
                <li><strong>Guwahatiâ€™s Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport</strong> is the nearest major
                    airport for travelers coming from outside Meghalaya, offering flights to major cities across India.
                    From there, travelers can travel by road to Meghalaya.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div>

            <b class="heading">4. Water Transport</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Water transport is not commonly used for travel within Meghalaya as it is a hilly state with limited
                    navigable rivers. However, the state is home to some rivers like the <strong>Brahmaputra</strong>
                    and <strong>Umiam</strong>, which have potential for future development in terms of tourism.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">5. Helicopter Services</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Meghalaya has recently started offering <strong>helicopter services</strong> between Shillong and
                    Guwahati, primarily for tourism purposes, offering a scenic view of the hills and valleys.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">6. Future Developments</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The <strong>Shillong Bypass</strong> project and expansion of National Highways are expected to
                    enhance road connectivity and make traveling through the state smoother.</li>
                <li>The Meghalaya government has also been exploring <strong>electric buses</strong> and <strong>cable
                        cars</strong> for promoting eco-friendly transport solutions in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">7. Challenges</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to the hilly terrain, some rural areas are not well connected by roads, which makes
                    transportation difficult during the monsoon season, when landslides are common.</li>
                <li>The road infrastructure in the state, although improving, still needs to be upgraded in certain
                    areas to handle higher volumes of traffic.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>

            <b class="heading">Conclusion</b>
            <p>While road transport remains the dominant mode of transportation in Meghalaya, the state's transport
                system is evolving with improvements in infrastructure and new modes of transport, making it more
                accessible for locals and tourists alike.</p>
