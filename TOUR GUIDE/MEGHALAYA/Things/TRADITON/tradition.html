            <b class="heading">1. Tradition of Meghalaya</b>

            Meghalaya, known for its scenic beauty and diverse cultural heritage, has rich and unique traditions that
            reflect the customs, beliefs, and lifestyle of its indigenous communities. The people of Meghalaya,
            primarily from the Khasi, Garo, and Jaintia tribes, continue to practice customs passed down through
            generations, which are deeply intertwined with nature, spirituality, and social values. Below are some
            significant traditional aspects of the state:

            <b class="heading">2. Matrilineal Society</b>
            One of the most distinctive features of Meghalaya's traditions is its <strong>matrilineal system</strong>,
            especially among the Khasi and Jaintia tribes. In this system, lineage and inheritance are traced through
            the mother rather than the father. The youngest daughter, known as the "khatduh," inherits the family
            property and wealth, and the family's name is passed down through her. This practice gives women a
            significant role in both family and societal affairs, and they are seen as the primary decision-makers in
            households.
