    <div class="big">
        Jharkhand's traditional dress reflects the cultural diversity and indigenous heritage of the state. Clothing in Jharkhand is influenced by the state's tribal population, with each tribe adding its distinct touch, style, and pattern to traditional attire. The attire of Jharkhand's people is simple yet colorful, blending practicality with culture.

### **1. Men’s Traditional Attire**
- **Dhoti**: The traditional dress for men in Jharkhand is the **dhoti**, a long piece of cloth wrapped around the waist and legs. It is often made of white or off-white fabric and is worn during festivals, cultural celebrations, and daily life in villages.
- **Kurta and Shirt**: Men usually pair the dhoti with a **kurta** (a long shirt-like garment) or a simple shirt. For special occasions, they may wear an **angrakha** (a type of traditional tunic) or a jacket with embroidery or mirror work.
- **Headgear**: In some tribal communities, men wear headgear, such as **pagris** (turbans) or cloth wraps, particularly during rituals and festivals.

### **2. Women’s Traditional Attire**
- **Saree**: The traditional dress for women in Jharkhand is the **saree**, typically worn in a unique style that reflects tribal customs. Women often wear **red-bordered sarees** or sarees with vibrant patterns and colors for special occasions.
- **Parthan and Panchi**: Some tribal women, especially from the **Santhal** community, wear a two-piece garment known as **parthan** (lower garment) and **panchi** (upper garment). The style and draping differ from tribe to tribe.
- **Blouses and Tops**: Women pair their sarees with **blouses** or simple tops, which may be adorned with embroidery, beads, or shells.

### **3. Ornaments and Accessories**
- **Silver Jewelry**: Silver jewelry is widely worn by both men and women, including **earrings, necklaces, anklets, bangles,** and **rings**. The designs often have intricate motifs inspired by nature.
- **Beadwork**: Bead necklaces and other beadwork are popular among tribal women. The colorful bead jewelry is handcrafted and often holds cultural or spiritual significance.
- **Bichua and Paijan**: **Toe rings (bichua)** and anklets (paijan) are common ornaments among women.
- **Tattoos and Body Painting**: Some tribes have the tradition of adorning themselves with tattoos or body painting, often with motifs representing their community's history and spirituality.

### **4. Fabrics and Patterns**
- **Natural Fibers**: Traditional clothing is often made from locally available natural fibers, such as **cotton** and **tussar silk**. The fabric is usually handwoven, reflecting the state's rich tradition of textile arts.
- **Embroidery and Weaving**: Clothes often feature unique embroidery, mirror work, or simple patterns reflecting tribal motifs and geometric designs.

### **5. Modern Influence and Adaptations**
- While traditional attire remains significant in rural and tribal areas, modern and Western clothing is commonly seen in urban regions of Jharkhand. Many people blend traditional elements with modern styles, creating a unique mix of old and new.
- On special occasions, festivals, or during rituals, traditional dress still holds a place of pride and is widely worn to reflect cultural heritage.

### **6. Tribal Variations in Clothing**
- Different tribes in Jharkhand have their unique dress codes and styles. For example:
  - **Santhal Women**: Often wear a short saree draped in a specific style, paired with traditional jewelry.
  - **Oraon Tribe**: Women typically wear sarees with distinct draping styles and floral patterns.
  - **Munda Tribe**: Men and women wear simple, colorful garments, and their attire often signifies their tribal identity.

Jharkhand's traditional dress serves as a symbol of its cultural diversity and rich heritage, preserving ancient customs while adapting to the needs of modern society. The use of vibrant colors, intricate jewelry, and unique draping styles highlights the aesthetic and cultural significance of clothing in the state's tribal and rural communities.
