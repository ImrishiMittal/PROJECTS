            <h1>JHARKHAND</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
        <div class="size">Jharkhand, a state in eastern India, was carved out of the southern part of Bihar on November 15, 2000. Known as the "Land of Forests," Jharkhand is rich in natural resources, with lush forests, diverse wildlife, and significant mineral wealth, including coal, iron ore, copper, bauxite, and uranium. The stateâ€™s capital is Ranchi, which is also its industrial and educational hub.</div>
        <div class="size">The state's economy is primarily driven by mining, agriculture, and industries. Jharkhand is one of the leading states in India for coal production, contributing significantly to the country's energy sector. Major industries include steel production, with notable companies like Tata Steel operating in the state. Agriculture remains a crucial part of the economy, with rice, maize, and pulses being the main crops.</div>
        <div class="size">Culturally, Jharkhand is a mosaic of tribal communities, each with its unique traditions, languages, and festivals. Tribes like the Santhal, Oraon, Munda, and Ho have a significant presence. Tribal festivals such as Sarhul and Karma are celebrated with great enthusiasm, highlighting the region's rich cultural heritage.</div>
        <div class="size">Jharkhand boasts a variety of tourist attractions, including natural landscapes, waterfalls, and wildlife sanctuaries. Betla National Park, known for its diverse fauna, and Hundru Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in the state, are popular destinations. The state is also home to religious sites like the Baidyanath Temple in Deoghar, a major pilgrimage center for Hindus.</div>
        <div class="size">Despite its rich resources and cultural wealth, Jharkhand faces challenges like poverty, unemployment, and infrastructural deficits. The state has been working towards improving its education and healthcare systems, along with enhancing its industrial infrastructure to attract more investments.</div>
        <div class="size">Overall, Jharkhand is a state with immense potential, combining natural beauty, cultural diversity, and economic resources, striving towards development and prosperity while preserving its unique identity.</div>
