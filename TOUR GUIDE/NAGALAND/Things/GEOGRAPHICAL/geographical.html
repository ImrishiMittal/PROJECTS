        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Monsoon Season</strong> (June to September): The region experiences a significant amount of rainfall due to the <strong>monsoon</strong> 
                winds. The <strong>Patkai Range</strong> causes the <strong>orographic rainfall</strong>, which means that the mountains push moist air upwards, 
                leading to heavy rains. The state can receive up to <strong>2,500 mm</strong> of rainfall during the monsoon months, making it very humid during 
                this period.</li>
            <li><strong>Winter Season</strong> (November to February): The <strong>winter months</strong> are cold, especially in the higher altitudes, where 
                temperatures can dip to as low as <strong>5°C</strong>. The cold temperatures in the mountainous regions contrast with the mild climate in the 
                plains, particularly around <strong>Dimapur</strong> and <strong>Kohima</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Summer</strong> (March to May): Summers are relatively moderate, with temperatures ranging from <strong>20°C to 30°C</strong>, depending on 
                the region. The warmer temperatures are usually felt in the plains and valleys, while the higher altitudes remain cooler.</li>
