    <h1>FOOD</h1>

    <div>
        The cuisine of <strong>Nagaland</strong> is as diverse and rich as its culture, reflecting the various Naga
        tribes, each with its own unique cooking styles and ingredients. Naga food is typically simple, hearty, and rich
        in flavors, often characterized by <em><strong>spices</strong></em>, <em><strong>fermented foods</strong></em>,
        and <em><strong>smoked meats</strong></em>. The traditional food is deeply connected to the agricultural
        lifestyle of the Naga people, as they rely heavily on locally sourced ingredients like
        <em><strong>rice</strong></em>, <em><strong>vegetables</strong></em>, and <em><strong>meat</strong></em> from
        hunting or farming. Here are some of the key components of Naga cuisine:
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">1. Rice</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rice</strong> is a staple food in Nagaland and is consumed with most meals. It is typically
                served with a variety of <em><strong>vegetables</strong></em>, <em><strong>meats</strong></em>, and
                <em><strong>chutneys</strong></em>. Rice is often accompanied by stews or curries made from locally
                grown produce.</li>
            <li>In some regions, <strong>sticky rice</strong> or <strong>fermented rice</strong> is also commonly
                consumed.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <b class="heading">2. Meat</b>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong> plays a central role in Naga cuisine, especially in the form of
                <strong>pork</strong>, <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>goat</strong>, and <strong>beef</strong>. The
                Naga people are known for their love of <em><strong>smoked meats</strong></em>, which are often dried or
                cured for preservation.</li>
            <li><strong>Wild game</strong> such as <em><strong>deer</strong></em>, <em><strong>pigeon</strong></em>, and
                <em><strong>wild boar</strong></em> is also hunted and forms part of the traditional diet in rural
                areas.</li>
