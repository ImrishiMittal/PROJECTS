        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <b class="heading">Other Languages and Dialects</b>
        <p>
            Nagaland also has several <strong>minority languages</strong> and dialects spoken by smaller tribal communities. Some of these include:
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Nepali</strong>: Due to migration, a significant number of Nepali speakers reside in the state, particularly in the <i>Dimapur</i> district, which has a diverse ethnic population.</li>
            <li><strong>Bengali</strong>: Bengali is spoken by a section of the population, especially in urban areas and by some traders and migrants.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <b class="heading">Multilingualism and Language Use</b>
        <p>
            Nagalandâ€™s cultural diversity is mirrored in its <strong>linguistic landscape</strong>, and most Naga people are <strong>multilingual</strong>. A person from Nagaland may speak multiple languages, including their native tribal language, <i>Hindi</i>, <i>English</i>, and possibly a regional language like <i>Assamese</i> or <i>Bengali</i>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vernacular Languages</strong>: In rural areas, people typically speak their native tribal languages at home, while <i>Angami</i>, <i>Sumi</i>, <i>Lotha</i>, and other major languages often serve as <i>lingua franca</i> for inter-tribal communication.</li>
            <li><strong>English as a Link Language</strong>: Since English is widely spoken and understood, it serves as the common language of education and communication in urban areas and in official settings.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <b class="heading">Writing Systems</b>
        <p>
            Most Naga languages, including <i>Ao</i> and <i>Lotha</i>, have adopted the <strong>Roman alphabet</strong> for writing. The <i>Angami</i>, <i>Sumi</i>, and other languages also use the Roman script. Some languages, like <i>Konyak</i>, have developed <i>scripts</i> based on the Roman alphabet or <i>modified Latin scripts</i>, while others have <i>oral traditions</i> and have not yet fully developed writing systems.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <b class="heading">Preservation and Promotion of Languages</b>
        <p>
            The government and local organizations in Nagaland are increasingly focusing on <strong>language preservation</strong> and promoting the use of indigenous languages, particularly in rural and tribal areas. Efforts include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cultural and Linguistic Documentation</strong>: Various organizations are working to document and preserve languages through <i>research</i>, <i>texts</i>, and <i>language education</i>.</li>
            <li><strong>Language in Education</strong>: Efforts are being made to teach tribal languages in schools, with some local languages included as subjects in the curriculum.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <strong>Naga people's love for their language</strong> and culture has led to the promotion of regional languages alongside <i>English</i> as part of their <i>identity</i> and <i>heritage</i>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <b class="heading">Conclusion</b>
        <p>
            Nagaland is one of the most <strong>linguistically rich</strong> states in India, with a vast array of tribal languages spoken across its different districts. <i>English</i> serves as the <strong>official language</strong>, but the indigenous languages of the Naga tribes are crucial to the state's cultural fabric. While <i>multilingualism</i> is common, the preservation of these languages continues to be an important issue for the people of Nagaland, reflecting the strong sense of tribal and cultural identity within the state.
