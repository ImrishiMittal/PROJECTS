        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <div class="size">Nagaland, a vibrant state in the northeastern region of India, is known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse tribes, and scenic landscapes. Established on December 1, 1963, it became the 16th state of India. With Kohima as its capital and Dimapur as its largest city, Nagaland spans an area of 16,579 square kilometers and is bordered by Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, and the country of Myanmar.
        </div>

        <div class="size">
            Nagaland is home to 16 major tribes, each with its own distinct customs, languages, and attire. Some of the prominent tribes include the Angami, Ao, Konyak, Lotha, and Sumi. These tribes celebrate various traditional festivals, the most notable being the Hornbill Festival, held annually in December. This festival, named after the state bird, the Great Hornbill, is a grand celebration showcasing the state's cultural diversity through music, dance, sports, and food.

        <div class="size">
            The state's topography is characterized by hilly terrain and lush green forests, contributing to its scenic beauty and biodiversity. Mount Saramati, the highest peak in Nagaland, stands at an elevation of 3,841 meters and is located in the eastern part of the state, bordering Myanmar. The Dzukou Valley, often referred to as the "Valley of Flowers," is another prominent natural attraction known for its pristine landscapes and seasonal blooms.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Nagaland's economy is primarily agrarian, with over 70% of the population engaged in agriculture. The main crops include rice, maize, millets, and pulses. Recently, the state has also been focusing on developing its horticulture and floriculture sectors. Additionally, handloom and handicrafts are significant contributors to the local economy, with intricate designs and craftsmanship reflecting the state's cultural heritage.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The political landscape of Nagaland has been shaped by its history of insurgency and the quest for a distinct Naga identity. The Naga movement for independence began in the early 20th century, leading to decades of conflict. However, various peace accords and ongoing negotiations have significantly improved the situation, fostering an environment conducive to development and progress.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Education and healthcare in Nagaland have seen substantial improvements over the years. Institutions like Nagaland University and several other colleges offer higher education opportunities, while numerous healthcare initiatives aim to enhance medical services across the state.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Nagaland's connectivity with the rest of India has improved with better road networks, rail links, and air travel facilities, particularly through the Dimapur Airport. This improved infrastructure supports tourism and trade, contributing to the state's overall development.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            In essence, Nagaland is a land of natural beauty and cultural richness, where tradition and modernity coexist, creating a unique and vibrant tapestry that continues to evolve.
