    <h1>DRESS</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <div>
            The traditional dress of Goa reflects the state’s unique blend of Indian and Portuguese influences, as well
            as its tropical climate and relaxed lifestyle. While modern clothing is widely embraced by Goans, especially
            in urban and coastal areas, traditional attire is still worn on special occasions, festivals, and religious
            ceremonies. Here’s an overview of the typical dress worn in Goa:
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">1. Traditional Attire for Women</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saree</strong>: Goan women traditionally wear the saree, but with a unique draping style
                    known as <em>Nav-Vari</em> or the nine-yard saree. This style involves wrapping the saree in a way
                    that resembles trousers, which is particularly comfortable for women engaged in physical work. This
                    type of saree draping is similar to the traditional attire seen in Maharashtra.</li>
                <li><strong>Pano Bhaju</strong>: Another traditional outfit worn by women, especially during festivals
                    and dances, is the <em>pano bhaju</em>. It consists of a long skirt paired with a blouse or choli,
                    and a shawl or <em>pano</em> draped gracefully around the shoulders or head.</li>
                <li><strong>Colorful and Embellished Clothing</strong>: Goan women’s traditional attire often features
                    bright colors, intricate embroidery, and embellishments like beads, shells, and mirrors. The
                    patterns and designs reflect the state’s rich cultural heritage.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Traditional Attire for Men</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dhoti and Shirt/Kurta</strong>: Goan men often wear a <em>dhoti</em>, a rectangular piece of
                    unstitched cloth tied around the waist, along with a shirt or <em>kurta</em>. This attire is simple,
                    comfortable, and suited to the tropical climate of the region.</li>
                <li><strong>Kunbi Saree</strong>: While primarily worn by women of the <em>Kunbi</em> tribe, which is
                    one of the oldest tribes in Goa, men’s traditional wear sometimes includes elements of the
                    <em>Kunbi</em> attire, such as simple, checked, cotton fabrics for a rustic and natural look.</li>
                <li><strong>Western-Influenced Clothing</strong>: During colonial rule, many Goan men adopted
                    Western-style clothing, including suits, trousers, and shirts. Even today, suits and tuxedos are
                    popular for formal occasions like weddings and parties.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">3. Portuguese Influence</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gowns and Formal Wear</strong>: Due to centuries of Portuguese rule, Goan attire has
                    European influences. For special occasions, Goan Catholic women often wear western-style gowns or
                    dresses, and men wear suits and formal shirts. This blend of Indian and Portuguese styles makes Goan
                    clothing unique.</li>
                <li><strong>Bridal Attire</strong>: Goan Catholic brides typically wear white gowns with veils,
                    reflecting Portuguese and European traditions, while Hindu brides wear sarees in red, gold, or other
                    auspicious colors. The groom, on the other hand, usually wears a Western suit or a traditional kurta
                    with a dhoti.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">4. Casual and Beachwear</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beach-Friendly Clothing</strong>: Goa's popularity as a beach destination has influenced its
                    casual clothing style. Both locals and tourists often wear beach-friendly attire like shorts,
                    skirts, cotton shirts, and dresses that are light, comfortable, and suitable for the warm and humid
                    weather.</li>
                <li><strong>Sarongs and Wraps</strong>: Women often wear colorful sarongs, wraps, or dresses made from
                    lightweight fabrics, reflecting the vibrant and tropical vibe of Goa. Men may wear beach shorts and
                    loose shirts.</li>

                    sarees without elaborate embellishments. The attire is typically worn with minimal jewelry and

                <li><strong>Dance Costumes</strong>: For folk dances and performances, traditional costumes often

                <li><strong>Casual Western Wear</strong>: Due to Goa’s cosmopolitan nature and its reputation as a
                    tourist hotspot, Western wear like jeans, t-shirts, and dresses are widely worn by Goans,
                    particularly in urban areas. The influence of modern fashion is evident, especially among the
                    younger population.</li>
