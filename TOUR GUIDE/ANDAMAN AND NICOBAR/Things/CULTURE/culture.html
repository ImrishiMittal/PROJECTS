            The culture of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is a vibrant blend of indigenous tribal traditions and the influences of settlers from different parts of India. This unique cultural mix makes the islands culturally diverse and distinct. The indigenous tribes, such as the Great Andamanese, Onge, Jarwa, and Sentinalese, have lived on these islands for thousands of years. Their customs and lifestyles remain largely untouched, as they live in isolation, practicing hunting and gathering, and have strong ties with nature. Their art, music, and rituals reflect their deep connection to the environment.
        </div>

    In addition to the indigenous tribes, the islands have seen an influx of settlers from mainland India, including Bengalis, Tamils, Telugus, and Malayalees. This migration has introduced various languages, festivals, and traditions, creating a melting pot of cultures. Festivals such as Diwali, Christmas, and Durga Puja are celebrated with great enthusiasm alongside tribal festivities. This coexistence of different communities has fostered a spirit of unity in diversity.
