    <h1>GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION</h1>
    <div class="big">
        <div>
        The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a group of islands located in the southeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, between India and Myanmar, and form an archipelago that stretches over approximately 800 kilometers. Geographically, they lie between 6째 to 14째 North latitude and 92째 to 94째 East longitude, making them one of the most remote regions of India.

        <b>Key Geographical Features:</b>     
        <div>
            <b>1. Archipelago:</b> The Andaman and Nicobar Islands consist of around 572 islands, but only about 38 of them are inhabited. The islands are divided into two main groups:
            - Andaman Islands in the north.
            - Nicobar Islands in the south.
        </div>
        <div>
            <b>2. Proximity to Other Regions:</b>
            - To the west lies the Indian mainland, with the closest major city being Kolkata, around 1,200 kilometers away.
            - To the north is Myanmar, about 300 kilometers away from the northernmost island.
            - To the southeast is Sumatra, Indonesia, which is about 150 kilometers from the southernmost Nicobar Islands.
        </div>
           <div>
               <b> 3. Separation of the Island Groups:</b> 
               - The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are separated by the Ten Degree Channel, which is about 150 kilometers wide. The Andaman Islands are located to the north of this channel, and the Nicobar Islands are to the south.
            </div>
           <div>
               <b> 4. Mountainous Terrain:</b> The islands are part of a submerged mountain range that extends from Myanmar to Indonesia. As a result, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are primarily hilly, with dense forests and tropical vegetation.
            </div>
           <div>
               <b> 5. Coastline:</b> The islands have extensive coastlines with several beaches, coral reefs, and mangrove forests. The Ritchie's Archipelago and the Great Andaman Barrier Reef are prominent features that attract tourists and marine biologists.

           <div>
               <b>6. Climate:</b> The islands have a tropical climate, characterized by hot and humid weather throughout the year, with heavy rainfall during the monsoon season. The climate supports rich biodiversity, including rainforests, coral reefs, and a variety of wildlife.
            </div>
           <div>
               <b>7. Strategic Importance:</b> Due to their location in the Indian Ocean, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands hold strategic military importance for India. They provide control over the sea routes passing through the Malacca Strait, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world.
            </div>
        </div>
           <div>
               The islands' geographical position gives them not only strategic significance but also unique ecosystems, making them a hotspot for biodiversity and an attractive destination for eco-tourism.
