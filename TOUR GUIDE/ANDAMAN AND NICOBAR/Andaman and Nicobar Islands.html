            <h1>ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
        <div class="size">The Andaman and Nicobar Islands, an Indian archipelago located in the Bay of Bengal, are known for their pristine beaches, lush rainforests, and diverse marine life. Comprising over 500 islands, only a few are inhabited, with the main ones being Andaman and Nicobar. These islands are a union territory of India and have a unique blend of natural beauty, history, and cultural diversity.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The Andaman Islands are more developed and accessible compared to the Nicobar Islands. Port Blair, the capital city, is located on South Andaman Island and serves as the gateway to the archipelago. The city is home to the historic Cellular Jail, also known as "Kala Pani," which stands as a stark reminder of India's struggle for independence. This colonial-era prison once housed numerous freedom fighters and is now a national memorial and museum.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Tourism is a significant part of the Andaman Islands' economy, with visitors drawn to the stunning beaches, clear blue waters, and vibrant coral reefs. Havelock Island (recently renamed Swaraj Dweep) is particularly famous for its Radhanagar Beach, often listed among the best beaches in Asia. The island also offers excellent opportunities for snorkeling and scuba diving, with sites like Elephant Beach and the nearby Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep) being popular spots to explore the rich marine biodiversity.

        <div class="size">
            The islands' ecosystems are incredibly diverse, ranging from dense mangroves and evergreen forests to coral reefs and seagrass beds. These habitats support a variety of wildlife, including saltwater crocodiles, sea turtles, and a plethora of bird species. The Mahatma Gandhi Marine National Park and the Rani Jhansi Marine National Park are notable protected areas that aim to preserve the unique flora and fauna of the region.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The Nicobar Islands, in contrast, are less frequented by tourists due to their remoteness and restricted access, primarily to protect the indigenous tribes and the delicate environment. The Nicobarese and Shompen are the major indigenous communities, with distinct cultures and traditions that have remained relatively undisturbed over the centuries. The islands are also rich in biodiversity, with tropical rainforests that host a variety of endemic species.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            Economically, the islands rely on agriculture, fisheries, and increasingly, tourism. Coconut, areca nut, and spices are the main agricultural products. The region also benefits from a strategic location, making it an important point for maritime trade.
        </div>
        <div class="size">
            The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not only a treasure trove of natural beauty but also a region of great historical significance and cultural diversity. The blend of serene landscapes, vibrant marine life, and the legacy of India's freedom struggle makes these islands a unique destination. Despite challenges such as geographic isolation and the need for sustainable development, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands continue to captivate and inspire all who visit.
