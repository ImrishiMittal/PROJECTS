    <div class="big">
        The traditional dress of Jammu and Kashmir reflects the region's diverse culture, climate, and religious practices. Given its geographic and ethnic diversity, there is a wide range of traditional attire worn by people in different areas, from the Kashmir Valley to Jammu and Ladakh. Here is an overview of the distinct clothing styles found in the region:

### **1. Kashmiri Attire**
- **Pheran**: 
  - The *pheran* is a long, loose gown worn by both men and women, designed to provide warmth during the harsh winters. It typically extends to below the knees.
  - Men's *pherans* are usually plain and simple, while women's *pherans* often feature intricate embroidery around the neck, cuffs, and hem, including traditional Kashmiri designs like floral motifs.
  - Underneath the *pheran*, people often carry a *kangri* (a portable firepot) to stay warm.

- **Shalwar and Kameez**:
  - Women pair the *pheran* with a loose-fitting shalwar (pants) and a *taranga*â€”a traditional headdress worn by Kashmiri Pandit women on special occasions like weddings.
  - Men wear the *pheran* over churidars or loose trousers. The headgear often worn by men includes turbans or a skullcap called a *karakul* cap.

- **Headgear**:
  - **Women** often wear a headscarf known as a *taranga* in traditional settings. Muslim women sometimes wear a long scarf or *dupatta* to cover their heads.
  - **Men** frequently don the *karakul* cap, especially among the elderly, or wrap a turban.

### **2. Ladakhi Attire**
- **Goncha**: 
  - The *goncha* is a traditional robe-like garment worn by both men and women in Ladakh. It is made from wool or heavy fabric to provide warmth against the extreme cold.
  - The robe is fastened at the waist with a colorful sash known as a *sashthar* or *kamarbandh*.
- **Perak**: 
  - Ladakhi women wear the *perak*, a headdress adorned with turquoise, coral, and other precious stones. It signifies status and family heritage.
- **Bok**: 
  - Another common piece of attire among Ladakhis is the *bok*, a cape worn over the *goncha* for additional warmth.

### **3. Jammu Region Attire**
- **Women**: 
  - Women in Jammu often wear colorful **sarees** with heavy embroidery, *salwar kameez*, or *lehenga* during festivals and traditional functions.
  - The *ghagra* (long skirt) paired with a traditional blouse is popular among rural women, often embellished with intricate patterns and bright colors.
- **Men**: 
  - Traditional men's wear includes **kurta-pajama** or **dhoti-kurta**. During special occasions or religious ceremonies, men might wear *sherwanis* or jackets with traditional turbans.

### **4. Kashmiri Embroidery**
- Traditional Kashmiri clothing is often adorned with delicate and detailed embroidery, such as:
  - **Kashida**: Intricate needlework that features natural motifs, such as flowers, leaves, and birds, commonly found on *pherans*, shawls, and sarees.
  - **Tilla Embroidery**: A form of metallic threadwork, often in gold or silver, used on special occasion garments, particularly bridal wear.

### **5. Shawls and Wraps**
- **Pashmina Shawls**: World-famous for their softness and warmth, these shawls are made from the wool of Pashmina goats and often have elaborate embroidery.
- **Kani Shawls**: Woven with small sticks (kanis), these shawls display intricate patterns and are prized for their craftsmanship.

### **6. Footwear**
- **Traditional Footwear**: The people of Jammu and Kashmir often wear leather or woolen shoes, known as **Pulhor** or *jooti*. In Ladakh, fur-lined boots are common due to the cold climate.

### **7. Jewelry**
- Jewelry is an important part of traditional attire, with **Kashmiri women** wearing *dejhoor* (ear ornaments), *tika* (forehead adornment), and *kanthas* (necklaces).
- **Ladakhi women** are known for their ornate jewelry made of turquoise, coral, and silver, including heavy necklaces and earrings that are culturally significant.

The traditional dress of Jammu and Kashmir, with its rich fabric, unique embroidery, and diverse styles, reflects the beauty, craftsmanship, and cultural legacy of the region. These garments are not only a testament to the harsh climate but also a celebration of the rich heritage and artistic traditions of the state.
