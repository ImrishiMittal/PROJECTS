    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
    <div class="big">
        The history of Jammu and Kashmir is a rich tapestry woven with threads of ancient kingdoms, diverse cultural influences, colonial rule, and complex political dynamics. Here is an overview of the historical journey of this region:

        <div>
            <b class="heading">1. Ancient and Medieval Periods</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early History</strong>: The region of Jammu and Kashmir finds mention in ancient Hindu scriptures such as the *Nilamata Purana* and *Rajatarangini*, a historical chronicle written by Kalhana in the 12th century. According to these texts, Kashmir was originally a vast lake known as *Satisar*, drained by the sage Kashyap, after whom the region is named.</li>
                <li><strong>Hindu and Buddhist Influence</strong>: The region was ruled by various Hindu dynasties, and Buddhism flourished here during the reign of Emperor Ashoka (circa 3rd century BCE). The Kushan dynasty and later rulers like Lalitaditya Muktapida (8th century CE) further promoted Buddhism and Hinduism, creating a rich legacy of art, architecture, and learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Muslim Rule</strong>: The 14th century saw the establishment of Muslim rule in Kashmir when Shams-ud-Din Shah Mir became the first Muslim ruler of the region. The Sultanate period brought significant cultural, architectural, and religious changes. The Mughal Empire, under Emperor Akbar, annexed Kashmir in 1586 and integrated it into the Mughal Empire, bringing relative stability and prosperity. The Mughal emperors, particularly Jahangir, adored Kashmir, calling it “Paradise on Earth.”</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">2. Sikh and Dogra Rule</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sikh Empire</strong>: After the decline of the Mughals, Kashmir came under the control of the Afghan Durrani Empire until 1819, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire annexed it. This period lasted until 1846.</li>
                <li><strong>Dogra Dynasty</strong>: Following the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Treaty of Amritsar was signed between the British East India Company and Gulab Singh, a Dogra chieftain. As a result, Gulab Singh became the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir in 1846. The Dogras ruled the state as a princely state under British suzerainty until India’s independence in 1947. The Dogra rulers expanded the territory significantly, integrating regions like Ladakh and Gilgit-Baltistan into the state.</li>

            <b class="heading">3. Post-Independence Era</b>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Accession to India</strong>: In 1947, after the partition of British India, Maharaja Hari Singh, the last Dogra ruler, faced a complex situation. When tribal militias supported by Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Maharaja sought help from India. He signed the Instrument of Accession on October 26, 1947, merging Jammu and Kashmir with India under special circumstances, including autonomy over internal matters, as defined in Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.</li>
                <li><strong>Wars and Disputes</strong>: The accession led to the first Indo-Pak war (1947-48), resulting in a ceasefire and the establishment of the Line of Control (LoC), dividing the region between India and Pakistan. Jammu and Kashmir has since been a flashpoint for multiple conflicts, including wars in 1965, 1971, and the Kargil conflict in 1999.</li>
                <li><strong>Article 370 and Reorganization</strong>: Jammu and Kashmir enjoyed special autonomy until August 5, 2019, when the Government of India revoked Article 370, removing its special status and bifurcating the state into two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.</li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <b class="heading">4. Cultural Legacy and Heritage</b>
            <p>Throughout its history, Jammu and Kashmir have been shaped by a blend of diverse cultures, including Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic influences, each contributing to its rich heritage of art, music, dance, literature, and cuisine. Its syncretic traditions have earned it a unique cultural identity, often referred to as *Kashmiriyat*, emphasizing communal harmony and shared values.</p>
