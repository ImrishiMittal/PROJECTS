    <h1>JAMMU AND KASHMIR</h1>
    <div class="class">Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), located in the northern part of India, is a region known for its breathtaking landscapes, rich history, and cultural diversity. It became a Union Territory of India on October 31, 2019, following the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two Union Territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.
    </div>
    <div class="class">
        Geographically, J&K is characterized by its diverse topography, which includes the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, verdant valleys, and pristine rivers. The region is divided into three distinct areas: Jammu, the Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh. The Kashmir Valley is renowned for its stunning beauty, often referred to as "Paradise on Earth," with destinations like Srinagar, Pahalgam, and Gulmarg attracting tourists from around the globe. The Dal Lake, with its houseboats and Shikara rides, is a major highlight of Srinagar.
    </div>
    <div class="class">
        The economy of J&K is predominantly agrarian, with agriculture and horticulture playing crucial roles. Saffron, apples, and walnuts are some of the key products. Tourism also significantly contributes to the economy, with the scenic beauty, adventure sports, and religious tourism driving the sector. The region is also known for its handicrafts, including Pashmina shawls, carpets, and papier-mâché products.
    </div>
    <div class="class">
        Culturally, J&K is a mosaic of various ethnicities and religions, including Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and Buddhists. This diversity is reflected in its festivals, cuisine, and traditions. The region's rich cultural heritage includes traditional music and dance forms, such as the Kashmiri Rouf and Ladakhi folk dances. The annual Amarnath Yatra and the Vaishno Devi pilgrimage are significant religious events that attract millions of devotees.
    </div>
    <div class="class">
        J&K has faced political and social challenges over the years, particularly related to territorial disputes and internal conflicts. However, efforts towards peace and development continue, with the government focusing on improving infrastructure, education, and healthcare.
    </div>
    <div class="class">
        In summary, Jammu and Kashmir is a region of immense natural beauty and cultural richness. Its unique geographical features, diverse traditions, and ongoing developmental initiatives make it a significant and intriguing part of India.
